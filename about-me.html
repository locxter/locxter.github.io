                My name is Luca Schultz, I'm the person behind the pseudonym locxter, live in Northern Germany and love
                to tinker and find new ways of doing stuff.

                Nobody likes to read unnecessarily long self-descriptions about every aspect of a person, so here's a
                brief summary of my interests with additional information available for those, who care:

                <summary>🖥️ Technology enthusiast</summary>
                <p>
                    In my 9 years of programming and doing electronics projects I have slowly found love for writing
                    simple and clean yet effective code, doing every part of a project I reasonably can on my own and
                    using privacy respecting as well as
                    <strong>FOSS</strong>
                    software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently using
                    <strong>Kotlin</strong>
                    as my primary programming language, but have extensively worked with
                    <strong>C++</strong>
                    in the past and also write some Java, Rust as well as JavaScript/TypeScript code from time to time.
                    Other than that I prefer to use FreeCAD for designing parts, Inkscape for creating vector graphics,
                    VSCodium as my text editor as well as C++/Rust/JavaScript/TypeScript IDE and IntelliJ IDEA as my
                    Kotlin/Java IDE. My desktop operating system is heavily customized Linux Mint while I run CalyxOS on
                    my phone.

                <p>
                    One of the things that drives me the most is the desire to change something that I consider
                    meaningful within my lifetime. One day I noticed that
                    <strong>we don't have too little time in our lifes, but just don't use enough of it</strong>
                    - which then introduced me to the productivity community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, I'm still very much in the process of leveling-up my productivity game, but consider this
                    journey to be its own dedicated hobby of mine and an important aspect of who I am. That's also why
                    this topic gets roughly the as much attention on my blog as technology - sometimes a little more,
                    sometimes a little less.

                <p>
                    Everyone needs
                    <strong>a way to relax</strong>
                    and for me that's mostly reading. On the one hand, some might call me a bookworm, but I think the
                    amount of time I spend reading is absolutely reasonable and definitely better invested than watching
                    TV or doomscrolling social media. On the other hand, many of my friends question my taste in books,
                    since I mostly read generic sci-fi novels, thrillers or non-fictional works - not necessarily works
                    of art - and prefer the often inferior German translations.

                <summary>🔊 Music lover</summary>
                <p>
                    Since I don't drink coffee, tea or alcohol and would never even think about consuming other
                    substances,
                    <strong>my number one drug</strong>
                    to lift the mood, exercise extra hard or get into a productive mindset
                    <strong>is music</strong>
                    . Due to these very different settings, the music I listen to also differs vastly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When working, I stick to soundtracks of popular movies like
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">Inception</a>
                    or
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar</a>
                    . When excerising I exclusively listen to
                    <a href="https://kontra-k.de/">Kontra K</a>
                    and for everything else I'm fine with anything electronic as well as bass-heavy - preferrably along
                    the lines of Scooter, Harris & Ford and Hardwell.

                    <strong>the goal is not to become better than others, but better than yourself</strong>
