            <p>
                This is my "Now" page where I share what I'm currently doing, inspired by
                <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a>

            <h3>Priorities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mastering my university studies with laser focus:</strong>
                    Having spend the last two months integrating into my new environment in Stuttgart, it became clear
                    for me how easy it is to lose focus and thus produce lower quality results, once you start doing too
                    many things. That's why I will have a laser focus on mastering my university studies for the next
                    few months, as they lay the groundwork for everything else on my (rather rough, but at least
                    existing) long-term road map.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Building a vibrant network of connections:</strong>
                    The other key insight I made in recent months is just how important your social network is for both
                    personal and professional success. This means that building a vibrant network of connections
                    wherever possible is also a priority for me. It might sound like work, but for me it's actually
                    mostly about meeting new people, spending quality time with friends and having fun along the way...
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exercising in the gym and becoming fitter:</strong>
                    I'm already somewhat actively running and biking, but now also want to exercise in a more balanced
                    way and build some strength. Not always easy, but I have a training schedule and am working on it
                    together with friends.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Life is too short to do things you hate.</strong></li>
                <li>The goal is not to become better than others, but better than yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>An idiot admires complexity - a genius admires simplicity.</strong></li>
                <li>Perfection is gained through mediocrity with persistence.</li>
                <li><strong>Seek discomfort.</strong></li>
            </ul>
