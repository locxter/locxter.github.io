            <h3>2023-04-13</h3>
            <p>
                By now, everyone should have seen multi-room sound systems (like Sonos makes them) and understood that
                they are pretty damn cool. However, they also are mighty expensive - especially if you already have good
                speakers around your house - and usually lock you into a proprietary ecosystem, which makes them quite a
                hard pill to swallow. Thankfully, we can build our own, fully open source and configurable multi-room
                sound system with
                <a href="https://github.com/badaix/snapcast">Snapcast</a>
                for a fraction of the cost...
            </p>
            <p>
                Snapcast is flexible multi-room audio player that is based on a client-server architecture, where a
                single or multiple audio signals are fed to the server, which synchronizes all clients and forwards the
                audio to them based on audio stream groups. Audio sources can be Line-In,
                <a href="https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync">AirPlay</a>
                and
                <a href="https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot">Spotify</a>
                directly or more advanced music servers like
                <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">MPD</a>
                and
                <a href="https://mopidy.com/">Mopidy</a>
                , which intern support playback of local and streamed music from different sources. While the the server
                should run on Linux (possibly a low-power Raspberry Pi), clients are available for all major systems
                including
                <a href="https://github.com/stijnvdb88/Snap.Net">Windows</a>
                ,
                <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.badaix.snapcast/">Android</a>
                and even
                <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapcast-control/id1552559653">iOS</a>
                (although paid). This makes the system very flexible/extensible and allows for repurposing of abandoned
                hardware like outdated smartphones or laptops as cheap clients (although possibly with the caveat of
                security).

                Personally, I was only searching for quick, temporary solution to stream audio from my laptop to several
                bluetooth speakers, which is why I went with the simplest solution possible. Here's what I did:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I installed the server on my laptop via
                    <code>sudo apt install snapserver</code>
                    and disabled my firewall with
                    <code>sudo ufw disable</code>
                    for testing purposes (otherwise open the ports 1704 and 1705).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I installed the client on two Android phones, one Windows PC and one other Linux laptop via the
                    links from above and
                    <code>sudo apt install snapclient</code>
                    respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I disabled the the daemons with
                    <code>sudo systemctl disable snapserver.service</code>
                    and
                    <code>sudo systemctl disable snapclient.service</code>
                    respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added the required PulseAudio pipe sink to the server with
                    <code>
                        pacmd load-module module-pipe-sink file=/tmp/snapfifo sink_name=Snapcast format=s16le rate=48000
                        && pacmd update-sink-proplist Snapcast device.description=Snapcast
                    </code>
                    and started Snapcast via
                    <code>snapserver</code>
                    .
                </li>
                <li>
                    I started all the clients and connected them to the server via the automatic search or by manually
                    entering the IP address of my laptop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I connected the clients via Bluetooth to their dedicated speakers and played some nice tunes from my
                    laptop throughout the whole house.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Afterwards, I simply stopped the clients and server, deleted the pipe sink via
                    <code>pacmd unload-module module-pipe-sink</code>
                    and re-enabled my firewall with
                    <code>sudo ufw enable</code>
                    .
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Honestly, I was quite surpised how easy it was to get everything up and running as well as how stable
                the whole system worked. I never experienced any dropouts and the latency compensation also performed
                very well. This excellent performance in a somewhat shitty setup is also why I write this article, as I
                am just overall very impressed by this system. If you want to run Snapcast in any kind of permanent
                installation though, I would highly recommend you to take a deeper look at their
                <a href="https://github.com/badaix/snapcast">GitHub</a>
                as well as
                <a href="https://mopidy.com/">Mopidy</a>
                for a more sophisticated setup. If you have any personal experiences with Snapcast, feel free to let me
                know about them in the comments below...
