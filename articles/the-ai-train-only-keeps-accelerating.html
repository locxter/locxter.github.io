                The public release of ChatGPT (although officially still in research preview) really was and still is a
                quantum leap for AI and especially its public perception. With the release of Llama and a lot of leaks,
                the development in this area has reached an unprecedented pace, so let's take a look at what has
                happened, what will happen in the future and what an impact that will have on us humans...
            </p>
            <p>
                Undoubtedly, ChatGPT was
                <strong>THE</strong>
                big drop last year enabling millions of users to access a cutting-edge AI chat bot without any
                specialized knowledge through an easy-to-use web interface. This created an immense pressure on other
                big tech giants to release similarly capable systems in time, before losing the AI battle once and for
                all. Facebook, oh sorry - Meta of course, rushed out to release LLaMA on February 24, 2023, while Google
                announced it's take called Bard already on February 6, 2023, but only recently opened it up for early
                access. In all this hurry, it is really no wonder that mistakes happen, which can be seen by the
                mysterious leak of the weights for LLaMa enabling hobbyists all around the globe to experiment with this
                technology in their basements on relatively cheap hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current trend of integrating these system with browsers, search engines, office suites, code
                editors/IDEs and so much more really shows us the direction we're leading towards. In the next years an
                increasingly high rate of content we create and consume will be AI generated and for the most part
                without a meaningful loss in quality. But even though these systems certainly are very impressive and
                capable of generating persuasive texts, they aren't the holy grail (yet). Fundamentally, they still are
                text prediction systems without any checks to internal logic, which can lead to nice quotes like
                <code>3.5 > 4</code>
                . With the current, only increasing development speed however, I am very confident that these issues
                will be resolved shortly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, the well-planned use of AI technology has huge potential for boosting productivity by
                offloading simple repetitive task, getting immediate answers to specific questions without having to
                read a lot of (sometimes sketchy) websites and ultimately starting a new era of work, where human beings
                can focus on what they love doing and specialize in what they are interested in instead of having to
                work in a stupid 8-hour-a-day job just to pay their rent and keep their head above the water. On the
                other hand, there also are a lot of (potential) risks like invasion of the users privacy to an
                unprecedented extent, unbeatably good targeted advertising or computer generated content on social
                networks (lowering the world's productivity even further than it's already abysmal level) and ultimately
                leading to mass unemployment, when large amounts of jobs can be automated and society isn't able to
                catch up with the development (by introducing an
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income">Universal Basic Income</a>
                or similar measures).
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously, I don't know how long these developments will take (likely longer than shorter) or if my
                predictions are even remotely correct (they certainly are realistic though), but the current
                developments make me really optimistic about the future of human kind, if we as a species are able to
                adapt to the rapidly changing environment we are creating for ourselves. It's the closest thing to/the
                go-to tool for reaching the utopia of machines doing all the boring work and fixing the problems we
                created (like climate change) allowing us humans to really focus on enjoying live and being creative.
                Nevertheless, creating a real world Skynet also isn't out scope of what's possible in the long run - so
                AI overlords, please be merciful to me.

                With that said, I am very curious about your opinions and predictions on this very interesting, relevant
                and rapidly evolving topic. Feel free to post them in the comments down below...
            </p>
            <p>
                PS: If you are interesting in experimenting with these technologies yourself, I can highly recommend
                taking a look at
                <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>
                and
