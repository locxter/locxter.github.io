            <h2>Embracing Rust and Svelte in 2023</h2>
            <h3>2022-12-31</h3>
            <p>
                As I am a big fan of the KISS principle, I am currently using good old C++ as my primary programming
                language and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for web stuff (which I only do whenever there is no way around it by
                the way). For 2023, I plan to switch gears a bit and learn/use
                <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
                as well as
                <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>
                . In this article we are taking a look at why I am changing my mind and why I selected these new
                tools...
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly, I really enjoy the speed as well as freedom C++ provides. You can write code that is as high-
                or low-level as you want and be pretty sure that it will be as fast as it gets (as most "comfort
                features" are really well optimized and not expensive). Furthermore, C++ was the first programming
                language I learned and therefore has a special place in my heart. Nevertheless, I have found this choice
                to be quite exhausting and tedious lately, as the C++ ecosystem is very much behind in terms of
                libraries and tooling. Additionally, I find many advanced syntax features really hard to get behind as
                well as most compilers errors cryptic and not helpful (they mostly make me want to smash my head against
                the wall).
            </p>
            <p>
                For the native web stack I am using right now it is basically the same story. The tools themself are
                pretty nice, but it is just tedious to implement functionality youself that others already did a better
                job at. Additionally, browser compatibility checks are a huge pain point that you can get around by
                using frameworks, so lets talk about my new choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                My proposed replacement for C++ is
                <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>
                , because it is just as fast and low-level-capable, but has a much newer toolset (from what I heard
                <code>cargo</code>
                and
                <code>rustc</code>
                are your friends instead of worst enemies) and very vibrant community. Futhermore, the documentation is
                really nice and they provide a detailed
                <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">tutorial book</a>
                , which is awesome for learning and understanding the language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of writing everything web related from the ground up myself, I want to utilize the amazing
                framework
                <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>
                in the future. I have used it during my work placement at the
                <a href="https://www.kdo.de/">KDO</a>
                earlier this year and really enjoyed working with it, because of its intuitive design, but never worked
                with it in-depth. This will change next year, where I plan to relearn it and also start using
                <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>
                .
            </p>
            <p>Yeah, that is my plan for 2023 and I am really looking forward to how this will go...</p>
