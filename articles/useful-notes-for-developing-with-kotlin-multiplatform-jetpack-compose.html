            <h2>Useful notes for developing with Kotlin Multiplatform + Jetpack Compose</h2>
            <h3>2024-07-27</h3>
            <p>
                Since I'm working rather intensely with Kotlin Multiplatform for my current project BotvacCenter
                including all its benefits and drawbacks, I have accumulated quite some valuable knowledge about it as
                well its underlying Jetpack Compose UI framework. Thus, I want to share some of the knowledge I have
                struggled to find resources about with you in this post. It's rather a gathering of small notes than a
                continuous article, but hopefully still somewhat useful to someone out there...
            </p>
            <h3>Cross-platform settings</h3>
            <p>
                Almost any application needs to store some settings like username, encrypted password et cetera, but the
                implementations of settings storage is often platform dependent, which makes it an unnecessary hustle
                when working with a multiplatform project. Thankfully, the accordingly named
                <a href="https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings">Multiplatform Settings</a>
                library exists, which implements a common way of persisting key-value data aka settings. By default, you
                have to still write some platform-specific code to get it working, but the author was so kind to also
                develop the
                <code>no-arg</code>
                module, which takes care of everything platform-specific and allows you to write your entire settings
                logic in
                <code>commonMain</code>
                . Simply include the correct dependency described in the
                <a href="https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings?tab=readme-ov-file#no-arg-module">
                    README
                </a>
                and get started with the
                <a href="https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings?tab=readme-ov-file#settings-api">
                    easy-to-use API
                </a>
                . Personally, I like to develop a custom settings controller for all my project to handle reading and
                writing my application's settings, but this library makes it so easy that it almost becomes unnecessary
                boilerplate code - nice.

            <h3>Install and use debug + release builds alongside each other</h3>
            <p>
                When developing a new feature for an already mature application, it can be really handy to run the
                current debug build you're working on alongside a stable release version. Even cooler, you can easily
                expand this concept of differentiating the debug from the release version to the displayed app name and
                icon. Here's how to do it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Go into your
                    <code>build.gradle.kts</code>
                    and create a
                    <code>debug</code>
                    variant under
                    <code>buildTypes</code>
                    .
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then add
                    <code>applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"</code>
                    to this new variant in order to give debug builds a different application ID and thus allow them to
                    coexist with release builds. You can change the suffix to anything you like.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To customize your application name and icon, create the folders
                    <code>src/androidRelease</code>
                    and
                    <code>src/androidDebug</code>
                    alongside your existing
                    <code>src/androidMain</code>
                    to store the specific icon and app name for both build variants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simply copy your existing resources folder
                    <code>res</code>
                    from
                    <code>androidMain</code>
                    over to
                    <code>androidRelease</code>
                    to get started and make sure that you only include the relevant folders for the icon (
                    <code>drawable</code>
                    and various
                    <code>mipmap</code>
                    folders) as well as the
                    <code>values/strings.xml</code>
                    file storing your application name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then use the
                    <code>New/Image Asset</code>
                    dialog to add your modified debug icon to
                    <code>androidDebug</code>
                    , copy over
                    <code>values/strings.xml</code>
                    and change the
                    <code>app_name</code>
                    attribute to your desired debug app name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now release and debug variants should produce differently named applications with different icons.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Dropdown and time picker</h3>
            <p>
                For some stupid reason Kotlin Multiplatform still doesn't include stable dropdown or time picker UI
                components, which forces you to build your own solution. I don't want to praise my implementation as
                superior to anything else, but feel free to have a look at my
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/locxter/BotvacCenter/blob/main/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/gui/components/Dropdown.kt"
                >
                    dropdown
                </a>
                and
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/locxter/BotvacCenter/blob/main/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/gui/components/TimePicker.kt"
                >
                    time picker
                </a>
                components, that are surprisingly simple and haven't let me down.
            </p>
            <h3>Dark mode</h3>
            <p>
                Last but certainly not least I want to share a dark mystery with you - I'm talking about implementing
                dark mode with Kotlin Multiplatform, which is something I failed miserably at multiple times, before
                finally succeeding with a simple trick. You are most likely also wrapping the
                <code>MaterialTheme</code>
                composable around your actual UI code to give it the desired material styling. It also offers a
                <code>colors</code>
                attribute, which should turn the application into dark mode when setting it to the provided
                <code>darkColors()</code>
                palette. However, you will find that on desktop your application background still is white making
                everything poorly legible, while on mobile everything looks good except for the loading screen still
                being white. After lots of experimenting, here's the surprisingly simple solution to both of these
                issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Simply wrap your UI code in a
                    <code>Surface</code>
                    composable to get the dark background on desktop resulting in this hierachy
                    <code>MaterialTheme > Surface > Your UI code</code>
                    .
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go into
                    <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>
                    and change the
                    <code>android:theme</code>
                    attribute to
                    <code>@android:style/Theme.Black.NoTitleBar</code>
                    .
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With that said, I have presented my most precious discoveries about Kotlin Multiplatform + Jetpack
                Compose to you. Some of them aren't perfect for sure, but they have worked reliably for me so far and
                that validates their existance in my mind, even if they are ugly. As always, feel free to share your
                thoughts in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
