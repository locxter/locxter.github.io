            <p>
                Anyone still in school or just learning something new for that matter needs a good note-taking system to
                write down new knowledge, make it easy to find old information and help you become better. But
                especially in school with rather frequent and sometimes extensive exams, choosing an effective and
                trustworthy system is crucial to keep track of things and help with exam preparation, which is its own
                rabit hole in by itself. That's why I want to share the systems that worked really successfully for me
                in this article, so let's take a look...
            </p>
            <p>
                Most students of my generation take notes digitally and so am I. While some strongly prefer to type
                everything due to the higher speed once you're used to touch typing, others swear by handwriting for its
                much higher flexibility and more "natural" feeling. Personally, I do a combination of both with
                LibreOffice Writer as my word processor for the subjects that revolve mostly around producing text like
                all of the languages, social sciences etc. and Xournal++ as my handwriting program for all the other
                subjects with need for more free form notes like music notes, binary trees in computer science or
                diagrams and schematics in physics and math. The exact software you use doesn't really matter though,
                what matters is to keep a
                <strong>neat table of contents</strong>
                , give all your notes
                <strong>meaningful titles</strong>
                and
                <strong>highlight important sections</strong>
                right away to make them stand out. Some programs might offer useful tools to help with this, but it is
                worth the time even if you need to do everything manually, as it greatly reduces the effort to start
                with exam preparation once everything is already sorted by significance and you only have to look for
                the relevant parts for your exam among this selection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back at the last few years, I would highly
                <strong>recommend to take as many notes as possible by hand</strong>
                (preferably digitally), since I really notice a difference in how good my long-term memory of the
                subjects I typed versus wrote by hand in is. This is probably somewhat biased though, because I'm also
                much more interested in math, computer science and physics, which are the primary subjects a took
                handwritten notes in, and put in the effort to
                <strong>constantly create and study flashcards of the highlighted sections</strong>
                for these, which is also a huge booster for good memorization of knowledge. As I'm already taking
                digital notes, I also chose to use the popular flashcard software
                <strong>Anki</strong>
                and honestly couldn't be happier. After each school day, I simply
                <strong>
                    sit down for 10 minutes, take screenshots of my newly highlighted notes and create flashcards from
                    them
                </strong>
                and together with around
                <strong>15 to 20 minutes of card studying in the morning</strong>
                this already is an
                <strong>excellent exam preparation</strong>
                that is easy to maintain and also allows me to perform outstandingly well in class due to my active
                knowledge of all the topics we covered in the last few years. For my foreign languages I also just study
                some downloaded decks from the AnkiWeb community regularly and that's another amazing way to keep a
                language active you don't use that regularly otherwise - apart from consuming content in that language
                and chatting with other people of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to real exam preparation though, I do what anyone preaches about anyway -
                <strong>
                    starting early and favouring more, smaller learning sessions over fewer, but longer ones
                </strong>
                . For important exams I usually start of
                <strong>a month ahead of time</strong>
                by creating a rough
                <strong>studying plan</strong>
                in the projects section of my private note-taking software Standard Notes, which I organize by the GTD
                methodology. This plan includes a
                <strong>schedule of when to study</strong>
                (usually 1 hour per day) that I also transfer into my calendar to block this time for learning, a brief
                <strong>overview of the relevant topics</strong>
                and a
                <strong>detailed checklist of all the important aspects</strong>
                I can think of right away or that were mentioned by my teacher. Creating such a plan might sound silly
                and seem like a waste of time, but it takes even more pressure out of the preparation itself by giving
                me rather strict guidelines for what to do when, which makes actually doing it so much easier. The next
                step then is to
                <strong>create specific study notes</strong>
                (so-called
                <strong>Lernzettel</strong>
                here in Germany) containing relevant knowledge about all the topics mentioned in the studying plan,
                which usually is a rather straight forward process, since I already highlighted important sections in my
                general notes and just have to copy the relevant ones over.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dedicated Lernzettel is great to check if I know everything important and reactivate the knowledge
                I don't frequently need, but isn't my primary way of preparing for exams either - it's
                <strong>more of a reference book</strong>
                actually. In general, you can rank learning techniques in their effectiveness by how active their
                approach is and just reading through notes isn't that active at all and thus not preferred. Studying
                flashcards is already more active, since you have to recall to information before turning it over, but
                the real killer techniques are
                <strong>working through exercise exams</strong>
                and even better
                <strong>explaining the topic to others</strong>
                . With these you have to abstract the knowledge and put it to use or think of ways to explain it, both
                of which require a deep understanding of the topic at hand and are extremely active from a
                neuroscientific perspective. Just
                <strong>doing that as much as possible (preferably in a group)</strong>
                , worked wonders for me and has proven to be a reliable as well as somewhat fun way to prepare for
                exams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I would encourage you to just
                <strong>take the day before the exam off from studying</strong>
                and use it instead to do something fun and get a good rest. This final day won't have a meaningful
                impact, if you started preparing early enough, anyway and being in a
                <strong>good mental as well as physical state</strong> is thus much more valuable than one more hour of
                studying.
                <strong>Prioritizing health, nutrition and exercise</strong>
                is also an important aspect in general when preparing for exams, as your brain can only process
                information most effectively, if your body is also in a good condition.

                With that said, I hope that this article wasn't to frightening for you, maybe even somewhat helpful and
                am very curious about your personal preferences regarding note-taking and exam preparation. Feel free to
                share them in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
