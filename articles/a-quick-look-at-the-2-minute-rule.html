            <h2>A quick look at the 2-minute rule</h2>
            <h3>2023-09-07</h3>
            <p>
                Even though I have countless ideas for articles in my head right now and you have the right to demand a
                proper article, I only want to share a quick look at a very simple idea with you this week. The primary
                reason for this is that despite its simplicity it is amazingly effective and therefore truely deserves
                this space. I'm talking about the so-called 2-minute rule...
            </p>
            <p>It simply says:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>
                    If you think about doing something and know that it'll only take two minutes or less, just tackle it
                    right now.
                </strong>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Following it has three major advantages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It stops procrastination before it even has a chance to start.</li>
                <li>
                    It gives you a bit of a dopamine kick by finishing off a task relatively easily, which can be a much
                    needed mood booster.
                </li>
                <li>It keeps your task list within a managable length by preventing small things to even enter it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Additionally, it can serve as a stepping stone for you to accomplish larger tasks, since it gets you to
                work and it's generally way easier to keep working than to start from the get-go. However, nothing is
                perfect and so isn't this rule, as it prioritizes small things rather than your most important tasks and
                can therefore "waste" energy you might need for bigger projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I would see it more as something for household or everyday chores and not necessarily your
                demanding job, where keeping focus is much more important. With that in mind, I can't recommend it
                enough though...
