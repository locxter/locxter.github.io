                Everyone has dreams and wishes, but only a miserably low percentage of people actually manages to reach
                their goals. And this doesn't have anything to do with lack of discipline or to much impulsiveness (just
                look at Steve Jobs, who was one of the most impulsive beings of recent history), but boils down to a
                wrong attitude and misleading approach. That's why I want to share the general steps of building an
                asymmetric life as well as as the 5 most important steps to be productive with you in this article. So,
                let's get started...
            </p>
            <p>
                You might wonder what an asymmetric life even is and that's totally understandable, since even I have
                never heard of it until just recently. In a nutshell, is a concept from Graham Weaver that sees
                everything we do as in investment (of our precious lifetime) and tries to maximize the returns in the
                long run. This means that - on average at least - we should get more back from our actions than we
                invest. Thankfully, he doesn't leave us alone from there, but also provides us with his four elementary
                pillars to succeed at this. These are
                <strong>Do Hard Work</strong>
                ,
                <strong>Do Your Work</strong>
                ,
                <strong>Do It for Decades</strong>
                and
                <strong>Write Your Story</strong>
                . The first pillar basically says that everyone who has achieved outstanding success in his life worked
                hard for it and that there is not substitution for it. The second one focuses around the fact that life
                can be hard and it therefore is tremendously important to do things we truely believe in and are willing
                to suffer for - something that gives you a sense of purpose and aligns with your values. The third one
                highlights the immense value of time, since there is almost no chance of doing something you love for 10
                or more years and not become exceptionally good at it -
                <strong>time allows you to get from good at something to extraordinary</strong>
                . The last but certainly not least pillar is about planning your direction for life or at least the the
                next years, distilling clear goals out of it and ultimately stearing your path into a direction you
                like.

                Now, you are probably just as impressed as I was when I found out about this, but also ask yourself how
                to actually reach these goals. This is where the 5 step productivity model comes into play as it points
                out some of the things already implicitly stated by the four pillars to a greater extent:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Step 1: Set your direction, think about where you want to be in the future and define reasonable
                    goals to get there.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 2: Break down these larger goals into monthly and weekly inputs that are reachable and most
                    importantly also easily trackable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 3: Make time for these weekly missions in your calendar - ideally by creating appointments just
                    like when visiting the doctor - and protect them from life's messiness like your first child.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 4: Do these things well and consistently for a long time and don't feel disappointed when the
                    change isn't immediately noticeable. Improvement and especially perfection is a (endless) journey,
                    not a one-stop target.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 5: Take time to reflect and adjust as needed. While doing something we often notice that the
                    direction we first set isn't perfect and that's fine, as we are all just humans - just acknowledge
                    this fact without getting angry and try to be thankful for being able to adjust accordingly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Obviously, there is no 'one size fits all' approach to becoming successful, but I truely believe that
                the concepts mentioned in this article a great starting point for coming up with your own, ideal system
                to succeed at what really matters to you. Don't overthink your start, just get going with something you
                love and by doing it for long enough you will inevitably getter better at it. But do plan your general
                direction carefully at some point and evaluate your progress regularly along the way...
