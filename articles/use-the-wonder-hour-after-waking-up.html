            <h3>2024-11-02</h3>
            <p>
                My first month of working is over and I have to be honest with you, I didn't expect to be so exhausted
                when I get back home after work. Most of my coworkers just don't care and simply rest the remaining time
                of the day, but for me and anyone with more goals than just stagnating that is definitely not an option.
                So, let's talk about how I worked my way around this and why time in the morning is especially
                valuable...
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of you might be surprised that I talk about working, whereas my
                <a href="../about-me.html">"About me" page</a>
                and countless of my articles clearly state that I'm studying. The truth is both or something in between
                to be more specific. I'm participating in a so-called dual study program from a big German automotive
                company, which combines studying in a technical field at university (computer science in my case) with
                real-world experience in the company. There are different approaches to splitting these two parts up,
                but I'm doing three-month-long alternating periods of working and studying. Unlike switching weekly,
                this means that I consider myself to know both worlds fairly well and it allows me to really get into
                each of these two lifestyles - for better or for worse. At the company, I work for 35 hours a week plus
                some overtime here and there, while my on-site workload is much less at the university. Which is more
                than made up by the time I have to invest at home polishing up notes, really getting behind concepts and
                preparing for exams though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, you probably also know this feeling of pure exhaustion and just wanting to rest once you get
                back through the door after working, don't you? In case it wasn't clear to you before, this is
                absolutely normal and nothing to feel ashamed of or even hide from others - everyone I talk to knows it,
                no matter their age or background. This just has something to do with the fact that our monkey brains
                aren't made for such extended periods of concentrated work - we can usually only stand one ultradian
                cycle (aka. 90 minutes) before we need about 20 minutes of rest. Work obviously doesn't provide us with
                that, so it's no wonder that everyone feels exhausted after it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't want to just sit around for the rest of your day, you have probably already figured out
                that a power nap, exercising or even just going for a walk outside can work wonders to clear your mind
                and feel more energized again. Don't get me wrong, these certainly have their place and they offer some
                real value (especially exercising is THE hack you can apply to your life), but they also aren't perfect.
                In fact, anything except real rest just isn't real rest and that means that despite feeling much better
                after exercising your body indeed still is exhausted and you shouldn't stretch for new productivity
                horizons. So enjoy that nice feeling, but don't use it as an opportunity to work for 8 more hours.
                <strong>
                    Your body needs rest or your won't stay as healthy, happy and energetic in the long run!
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what's the solution? Well, I have found that simply going to bed 1 or 2 hours earlier, moving your
                sleep cycle forward by that time and using this additional hour or two in the morning to work on your
                personal projects works wonders. That is also why I like to call it my
                <strong>wonder hour in the morning</strong>
                . After waking up, your mind is still fresh, you're energetic and you don't have any everyday duties to
                worry about yet - so you can go straight to work. And when I say straight, I mean within the first
                minute or so. This might sound overly drastic, but this ensures we still use the working mode our brains
                are in while sleeping to get into a flow state of working as productively as possible as fast as
                possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, one more important aspect you have to keep in mind is that the work you want to do needs to be
                very clearly laid out beforehand or otherwise you will just waste your time with figuring out what
                you'll do. I resolve this issue by taking 5 to 10 minutes each evening to think about what I want to do
                the next morning, opening all needed programs and already creating documents or what else I might need.
                This allows me to focus on the work at hand and only the work at hand and makes a shocking difference in
                what I'm able to get done.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, I highly encourage you to give this approach of using the wonder hour after waking up a
                shot and you'll see how it levels up your productivity game. As always, feel free to share your thoughts
                and experiences in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
