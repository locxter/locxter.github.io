            <p>
                Free and open source software (FOSS for short) is a big part of my life nowadays, but it has not always
                been this way. In this article I am going to talk about my personal FOSS journey and hopefully inspire
                you to make the switch away from evil big tech too.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the old days a few years ago, I used what you could call a "normie" hardware and software setup. I
                had a Google Pixel phone with the stock Android ROM, an iPad Pro for school stuff and a desktop computer
                running Windows 10. Additionally, I was registered at a million different online services, most of which
                I did not use on a frequent basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heck, I even got into the
                <strong>terrifiying</strong>
                field of web development with useless frameworks and thought about buying a Chromebook to fully emerge
                into the Google ecosystem. But luckly it did not came this far as I grew interested in using Linux,
                because my Windows install broke every 3 months or so and the pinguin is the only real man's operating
                system. This finally led me to learn about the importance/value of privacy as well as open source.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within a few months, I switched to the friendly
                <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>
                , deleted all of my unnecessary online accounts and started enjoying it! I was not ready yet to switch
                to a custom Android ROM, delete my Google account and sell my iPad though. This had to do with me either
                not knowing about the possibility (in case of the custom ROM) or having the requirement to hold on to
                the status quo for a bit longer due to school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, I was able to resolve the devices related issues in 2020/2021 by flashing
                <a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a>
                onto my phone as well as selling my by then not frequently used iPad and I am just holding on to my now
                unused Google account for one last project to finish. After that I am all out of the claws of big tech!
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides gaining a lot of privacy though switching to locally running solutions or privacy respecting
                services like
                <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>
                ,
                <a href="https://tutanota.com/">Tutanota</a>
                ,
                <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>
                and
                <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptPad</a>
                , I am just much more productive now that I am not wasting my time on Youtube anymore or beeing
                bombarded with ads everywhere I go online. This quality of life improvement alone was worth the switch
                in my humble opinion!
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not all a piece of cake though. When getting into the Linux world, you will likely end up distro
                hopping for a bit and have to fight with configurations every once in while. This aspect also generally
                applies: You have to like experimenting with different solutions and be fine with making compromises in
                some areas. For example, I use Signal for quick notes on the go as I have not found any good
                end-to-end-encrypted solution for this yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you are fine with that, you will have an
                <strong>amazing</strong>
                time and
                <strong>never</strong>
                look back! You also do not have to make the switch in one go, but instead can migrate to a private and
                open source infrastructure step by step. Just get started...
