            <p>
                After I started writing a diary about half a year ago, there always was the idea of starting a
                semi-frequent blog alongside it. Opposite to my diary, its purpose is not to get very personal thoughts
                out of my head, but to publish those ones that are actually beneficial to world - atleast in my humble
                opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the year coming to an end as well as me thinking more and more about leaving a long-lasting impact
                on the world, I finally put together this little website in plain HTML with the help of the amazing
                classless CSS framework
                <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">Water.css</a>
                and started writing this article.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, the plan for this whole thing is to not have a plan and just see how - or even if - it will
                work out for me. I almost always have some findings regarding technology, lifestyle or something else in
                my head which I want/need to get out and this could be the ideal platform for doing just that.
            </p>
            <p>So, stay tuned for more...</p>
            <p>Note to myself: Be not to harsh when looking back at this in a few years!</p>
