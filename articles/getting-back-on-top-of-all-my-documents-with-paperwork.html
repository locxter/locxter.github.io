            <h2>Getting back on top of all my documents with Paperwork</h2>
            <h3>2024-09-22</h3>
            <p>
                Every single one of us gets lots of documents from all the companies we have contracts with or buy
                something at as well as government authorities that inform us about changes or request information et
                cetera. This can quickly become an utter mess of paperwork without a proper system to organize it - both
                in the real and digital world. I wasn't quite happy with my system, so let's look at how I got back on
                top of all my documents with a document management system appropriately named Paperwork...
            </p>
            <p>
                To be clear right from the beginning, I was never one of the people who just spreads their documents all
                around the house and has exactly no system to manage them at all. Instead there always was a certain
                amount of organization to them, but especially with the common combination of analog as well as digital
                documents today I just wasn't able to organize them satisfiably for a loooong time. For the last two
                years or so, I have settled on scanning all of them regardless of their importance, giving them a
                filename following the scheme
                <code>year-month-date-title-or-important-aspects</code>
                and putting them into folders on my computers, of which I create regular and safely stored backups of
                course. The analog copy is then simply filed in a chronological physical folder, which holds all my
                documents of various importance mixed together, as it only really is a backup solution and not needed
                for referencing.
            </p>
            <p>
                This system has the big advantage of being incredible easy to transfer between computers and operating
                systems without any vendor lock-in, since everything just is PDF documents inside folders in your normal
                file explorer. But due to its lovely simplicity it also has some major drawbacks that made it unbearable
                for me as the time progressed. First and foremost, you have to create meaningful folders for everything
                and structure them at least somewhat sensibly, which is quite a bit harder than it might sound at first.
                The much bigger issue sometimes is to decide into which folder a new document fits however, as it's not
                too uncommon for a single document to cover different topics and impact multiple folders. This basically
                forces you to only acknowledge a sub-set of its topics or copy it multiple times, which is an
                unnecessary waste of storage space. Finding documents is even worse than storing new ones though,
                because you single-handedly rely on your file explorers search feature to find them, which is some cases
                (I'm looking at you
                <code>explorer.exe</code>
                ) can be painfully slow and almost always just looks at the filenames instead of their contents - making
                it a nightmare to find important documents you know you have, but forgot where you put them.
            </p>
            <p>
                A document management system aims to make this whole process of scanning new documents, organizing as
                well as finding them much easier by directly accessing your scanner, performing OCR (Optical Character
                Recognition) and allowing you to add a number of tags to them - avoiding the whole folder dilemma. Most
                of them are quite complicated on their own though, require more than a bit of training to get used to
                and can be quite pricey, since they are primarily used in company offices. Thankfully an Open Source one
                called
                <a href="https://www.openpaper.work/en/">Paperwork</a>
                exists that is available on all major operating system free of charge, doesn't use a proprietary storage
                format or database and follows the easy to learn
                <code>Scan & Forget</code>
                metaphor.
            </p>
            <p>
                After defining a location for the applications
                <code>papers</code>
                folder, into which all documents and related information is stored in commonly used formats, and quickly
                setting up your primary scanner, you can start managing your documents by either importing existing ones
                into the program or putting them on your scanner and pressing
                <code>Scan document</code>
                . The software then performs OCR on the document to make it easily searchable by its whole text and adds
                the current date to the file. After that's finished you can change the date manually and add tags
                (called
                <code>Labels</code>
                ) as well as additional keywords as you want to make finding documents just a little easier - that is it
                though, no more work required. Now you can easily search through all your documents including their
                contents with little to no hassle and just get the annoying job of finding the invoice from three years
                ago to claim your warranty done. Since all the computation and data storage is done locally, you also
                don't have to worry about privacy concerns or data breaches - a rarity in today's world!
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, I highly recommend you to give Paperwork a try and start getting back on top of all your
                documents - just like I did. Even if you only use it for new documents - which you really shouldn't,
                because the import features for existing ones works remarkably well - it will offer great value to you
                for no cost except saving you time once you need to find that damn document. As always, feel free to
                share your thoughts and experiences in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
