            <h3>2024-11-29</h3>
            <p>
                As a surprise to myself and all my fellow students, we already have to start writing our first
                scientific essays in these early months at university. Having had a few weeks of experience with LaTeX
                now, I can already tell you that I truly love writing with it and don't want to miss it every again for
                anything more complex than a simple letter. So, let's talk about my experience with it as well its
                strengths and weaknesses in this article...
            </p>
            <p>
                First things first, I want to mention that nobody forced us so early on to use LaTeX for our essays.
                Generally speaking, we are free to use whatever we like as long as the final result meets the given
                styling criteria. However, meeting these is quite a bit easier, if you can use one of the provided
                templates for Word or LaTeX. Word was immediately out of question for me though, since I could only run
                it on a rather locked down company laptop (since there isn't a Linux port of course) and more
                importantly just can't wrap my head around using many of it's more advanced features. Sure, this has
                also to do with a lacking willingness to learn it, but my solution was simply to give LaTeX a try and
                see where it leads me - I can always go back to the hot garbage most word processors (including
                LibreOffice) are, if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily for me, using LaTeX turned out to be an amazing experience - at least once you get it up and
                running. Installing a full TeX Live installation was mostly straight forward on Linux via the
                repositories (apart from the installer requiring you to spam
                <code>Enter</code>
                for some time to proceed), but the same story can't be told about the Windows company machines and
                MacBooks some of my fellows use. Just using Windows doesn't seem to be a huge drawback in this scenario,
                but not having admin rights and needing to install a whole Perl environment surely is. We eventually got
                it working by extracting a portable release to the right folders and manually adding the executables to
                the path variables, but this certainly wasn't a great experience. On the Mac side, using the MiKTeX
                distribution was recommended to us, but we weren't able to get it working on several machines, even
                after a few hours of debugging. Thankfully, switching over to a full TeX Live install via Homebrew did
                the trick and we also got these machines up and running. So if you aren't as tech-savvy or just want to
                start writing right away, using an online LaTeX editor like
                <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>
                can be a good alternative in my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the LaTeX installation works however, the whole experience luckily somewhat changes and most things
                just start to work - quite a lot better than most word processors actually. Just like most programming
                languages, you can just write your document in a basic text editor and compile it via the terminal to a
                viewable PDF document, but this approach gets exhausting quickly. Instead, I highly recommend you use a
                more advanced LaTeX editor like
                <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">TeXstudio</a>
                or even better the excellent
                <a href="https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop">LaTeX Workshop VSCode extension</a>
                . These provide sensible autocompleting, automatic compilation, (almost) live previews and many more
                quality of life features. Just like so many people on the internet tell you, setting up LaTeX is quite a
                bit more involved than installing Word or LibreOffice, but once the whole setup works using advanced
                features like proper citations, graphs et cetera becomes a breeze - especially compared to Word, which
                can drive you crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Setting up your whole document to comply with the given styling criteria can be a bit cumbersome one
                last time - but trust me, it's certainly worth it. If you can use an already set up template just like I
                am lucky enough to, you are pretty much in a golden spot. You can just start writing and copy the
                example code for referencing sources or adding images where needed. The great thing about LaTeX is that
                you can basically just focus on producing sensible text and all the formatting happens automatically.
                Need to create a table? Simply look up the code online or in an example, change the data and it
                automatically looks great, shows up in your list of tables and can be interactively referenced in your
                text. The same goes for citations, abbreviations and many more. But the real power of LaTeX only starts
                to show, once you start using some of the countless specialized packages. These allow you to easily
                create circuit diagrams, molecular structures, flow charts or even chessboards - just to name a few
                possibilities. It's this advanced functionality that makes it so popular in the scientific community
                with its niche needs and quite addicting - once you got to know its power and possibilities, you can't
                see yourself using such a primitive tool as Word ever again.

                With that said, I think it's easy to understand why I believe that writing with LaTeX is beautiful and
                you should give it a go too. Sure, for simple letters it's absolute overkill, but once you got it
                working why not enjoy its benefits there too? I'm really curious to hear about your experiences with it,
                so as always feel free to share your thoughts and experiences in the comments down below and have a
                lovely day...
