            <p>
                Have you ever experienced starting your day with a task or project and before you knew it, the entire
                day had passed and you were still working on it? On the other hand, have you ever started your day with
                the intention of being productive, but ended up procrastinating and achieving nothing at all? This
                phenomenon is not just a coincidence, there are psychological effects behind it and we can take
                advantage of them...
            </p>
            <p>
                The
                <strong>Zeigarnik Effect</strong>
                is a psychological phenomenon that suggests that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better
                than completed tasks. This means that when we start working on something, our brains become invested in
                completing it and we are more likely to continue working on it until it is finished. This is why when we
                start our day with a task, we are more likely to continue working on it for the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast, if we start our day with procrastination, we activate the
                <strong>Procrastination Effect</strong>
                . This effect occurs when we delay starting a task and it becomes increasingly difficult to start as
                time passes. This is because our brains become accustomed to not doing anything and we lose motivation
                to start anything at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the key to being productive throughout the day is to start your day with a task or project.
                By doing this, you activate the Zeigarnik Effect and set yourself up for a productive day. Here are some
                tips on how to do this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Plan your day the night before:<br />Before going to bed, take a few minutes to plan out your day.
                    Write down the tasks or projects you want to accomplish and prioritize them. This will help you
                    start your day with a clear plan and purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Start with a small task:<br />Starting with a small task can help you build momentum and motivation
                    to tackle larger tasks later in the day. It also gives you a sense of accomplishment early in the
                    day, which can boost your confidence and productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eliminate distractions:<br />Distractions can derail your productivity and make it difficult to
                    start working on anything. Eliminate distractions by turning off your phone, closing unnecessary
                    tabs on your computer and finding a quiet workspace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take breaks and sleep enough:<br />Taking breaks throughout the day can help you recharge and stay
                    focused. Use breaks to stretch, take a walk or do something that relaxes you. Also, remember to
                    sleep enough (ideally at least 8 hours) in order to unleash your full potential and not waste
                    precious time trying to wake up.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In conclusion, starting your day with a task or project is crucial for productivity. By activating the
                Zeigarnik Effect, you set yourself up for a productive day. Remember to plan your day the night before,
                start with a small task, eliminate distractions and take breaks. With these tips, you can make the most
                of your day and achieve your goals.
