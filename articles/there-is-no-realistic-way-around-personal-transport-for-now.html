            <h2>There is no realistic way around personal transport (for now)</h2>
            <h3>2024-02-15</h3>
            <p>
                Personal transport - especially its motorized forms - are a constant topic of discussion here in Germany
                and all around the globe, so it's only adequate to also give it some coverage here. Especially since I'm
                about to start participating in a dual study program of a big German automotive company from October
                onwards for the next three years (those who regularly read my articles already know), I feel the need to
                express some thoughts on the topic. So, let's get started without any further ado...
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a proud Gen Z, thankful for all the amazing opportunities life has given to our generation, but like
                almost everyone of my age also
                <strong>
                    very aware of the environmental and social problems we have to face rather earlier than later
                </strong>
                - climate change and mass unemployment due to automation only being the tip of the iceberg. Thus, I'm a
                big advocate of (almost) climate neutral forms of transportation like biking (my favourite), busses,
                subways and trains - and not only because of the lower emissions. Cars together with their accompanying
                infrastructure of roads, highways and parking lots take up a huge amount of space inside and outside of
                our cities, in general don't look good (compared to the greener surroundings we could have) and asphalt
                seals lots of surfaces preventing rainwater from seeping away. With the externalized cost of this public
                infrastructure and its maintenance also not being insignificant and the emerging security risks of every
                idiot being allowed to drive (after passing a rather sparse driving license test), the greenhouse gas
                emissions from personal transportation making up somewhere around 20% of total emissions depending on
                the statistics are just one part of the broader picture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much more
                <strong>climate friendly, safer and in the long run even cheaper concepts</strong>
                do exist and have so for a few decades. These range from publicly funded public transportation in all
                regions with legal requirements for minimum service (e.g. at least once per hour) over car-free cities
                with more vegetation and big bicycle lanes to car-sharing concepts and carbon-neutral engine designs
                (electric and hydrogen being the leading ones right now). Even though I really want these to work and
                believe in their viability in the far future,
                <strong>they are just not a viable, realistic option right now!</strong>
                There, I have said the unthinkable - like cars or not, they are not going away anytime soon. Before
                clicking away, let me explain myself for a second.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these concept are almost exclusively focussed on big cities, where they might work rather well
                (and somewhat do already), but aren't really an option for more rural areas or even just people, who are
                up to 50 km commute or so on a daily basis. These individuals need a means of individual personal
                transportation that follows their schedule (and not the other way around) to get anywhere from the next
                store to freetime activities and overall participate in a maintainable, social lifestlye - all of which
                is only possible with a car. Sure, ride sharing offers and other ideas along these lines can also work
                in these scenarios and should be implemented, but the vast majority of plans are just not viable.
                Additional points against a major transportation revolution in the near future are the immense
                investments necessary to make such a transformation reality - especially with the high national debts
                countries around the globe are facing - and the realization that most low-hanging fruit to make existing
                means of transportation more enviromentally friendly already has been implemented (catalytic converters.
                optimized combustion processes etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this has lead me to the verdict that there just is no realistic way around personal transport
                (for now). So, instead of competing in an (almost) impossible battle against it I opted for the more
                <strong>pragmatic option of trying to make the best of the current situation</strong>
                . For me, this includes the two major goals of making the still very much needed cars as
                emission-friendly and safe as possible - both of which I can work on at one of the German car companies,
                especially the one I chose for my computer science studies. As a matter of fact I won't work on
                developing the next generation drive train and even in my special field of automotive driving I
                certainly won't revolutionize the industry all on my own, but this way I can at least have a positive
                impact of many peoples' everday transportation needs (and through that hopefully lifes) and do my part
                to drive a long-needed transformation in the industry forward. Nobody knows what the future might bring,
                but for now this seems like the best available compromise to me and an excellent investment of some of
                my precious time on earth - we'll see.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, I hope to have made my rather ambivalent feelings and derived thoughts clear, look
                forward to all the marvellous things still to be developed and realized and
                <strong>continue to dream of a greener future</strong>
                . Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
