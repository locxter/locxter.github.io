            <h2>A quick look at using spotDL to back up your Spotify library</h2>
            <h3>2024-09-06</h3>
            <p>
                Although I still believe that my switch from RiMusic to Spotify is somewhat controversial and not
                perfect by any stretch of the imagination, I'm starting to notice some major quality of life
                improvements - not only in everyday use, but also when it comes to backing up my library. Until now I
                had to manually recreate my RiMusic playlists on the desktop and download them via a third-party app
                from YouTube Music, which was quite an effort, could be automated in theory and thus wasn't done as
                frequently as it should have been. Luckily, an awesome project called
                <a href="https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader">spotDL</a>
                exists that automates this hassle for all of us Spotify users, so let's take a quick look at it...
            </p>
            <p>
                At your first glance, you might be extremely stocked about the fact that methods to download all user
                playlists and/or saved albums exist, but they put all songs into s single folder and thus aren't really
                an ideal solution. This doesn't mean that spotDL is a bad piece of software, you just have to know how
                to do it properly with some (but very minor) human assistance:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Download spotDL:
                    <code>pip3 install spotdl</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check for successful install:
                    <code>python3 -m spotdl</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create separate folders for each playlist or album you want to back up, then:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Copy a link to the playlist/album from Spotify's sharing menu</li>
                        <li>Open a terminal in this folder</li>
                        <li>
                            Run
                            <code>python3 -m spotdl sync [link] --save-file [playlist/album name].sync.spotdl</code>
                            replacing the parts in brackets with your data
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wait for the operation to finish, this can take quite a few minutes depending on the
                            playlist/album size
                        </li>
                        <li>Repeat these steps for all playlists/albums</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To update your backup, simply run
                    <code>python3 -m spotdl sync [playlist/album name].sync.spotdl</code>
                    inside all folders
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you encounter an error (especially related to timeouts) during the process, just try to rerun the
                    command - it usually works on the second or third attempt
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Of course, we have to keep in mind that this application also sources its data from YouTube Music making
                some songs, podcasts or albums not available for backup, but as a free (as in freedom) and easy to use
                solution for backing up your library or just downloading your songs as MP3s for other uses (like DJing)
                it's pretty amazing in my mind. With that said, have a lovely day and see you next week...
