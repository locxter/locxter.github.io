            <h2>Enhancing Standard Notes with external packages</h2>
            <h3>2022-12-12</h3>
            <p>
                I already mentioned it in another article, but I have been abusing Signal as a notes and tasks app for
                quite some time now due to the lack of properly encrypted alternatives that are free to use. However, I
                recently gave Standard Notes a test drive and stumbled over some amazing external packages while doing
                so. So let's take a look at them...
            </p>
            <p>
                External packages are basically like browser extensions in the sense that they allow you to enhance the
                functionality of Standard Notes. To be more precise, they enable you to extend the features of the free
                plan drastically and even provide some features that are not available in the premium version.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, they are
                <strong>community build and maintained</strong>
                , which means that they are not part of the official product and could (in theory) lead to data breaches
                or security flaws. You have been warned! Nevertheless, I consider this risk to be extremely low as
                Standard Notes itself is a trustworthy open source project just like most extensions are.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are just looking for a way to bring the free plan on par with the premium version, the Github
                repository
                <a href="https://github.com/kylejbrk/standard-notes-open-extended">Standard Notes Open Extended</a>
                is for you. It offers all extensions of the premium plan, although they might have different names.
                Simply get a package link from
                <a href="https://github.com/kylejbrk/standard-notes-open-extended/tree/gh-pages#readme">here</a>
                , paste it into
                <code>Settings => General => Advanced Options => External Package</code>
                and hit
                <code>Install</code>
                .
            </p>
            <p>
                Another great source for community extensions is the
                <a href="https://github.com/jonhadfield/awesome-standard-notes">Awesome Standard Notes</a>
                repository. There you can find some quite intricate packages ranging from custom themes to flashcard
                editors or inventory systems. It really is amazing what you can do with Standard Notes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, I like to keep things simple though and just use 2 external packages (
                <a
                    href="https://kylejbrk.github.io/standard-notes-open-extended/exts/advanced-markdown-editor/index.json"
                >
                    Advanced Markdown Editor
                </a>
                and
                <a href="https://kylejbrk.github.io/standard-notes-open-extended/exts/simple-task-editor/index.json">
                    Simple Task Editor
                </a>
                ). But I am always experimenting with new ones and look forward to what the community develops next. So
                consider giving Standard Notes and it's extensions a try yourself...
