                Like everyone else, ChatGPT has opened my eyes to what is possible with modern AI technology. And while
                the default web interface is very user-friendly, it can only be described as terrible if you want to
                perform the same action frequently. Copy & pasting the same prompts over and over again with slight,
                repetitive changes each time is just a waste of time. That's why I started programming chtgpttlbx, an
                extensible ChatGPT toolbox designed to perform the same operations as easily as possible.
            </p>

                The feature set is currently quite limited, but can easily be expanded with contributions from third
                parties, which is the main reason I'm blogging about this project. Currently, you can request topic
                overviews, presentations and text as well as YouTube video summaries in addition to the normal chat
                known from the web interface. The program always uses Markdown for the output, so you can easily process
                the results with other tools like
                <a href="https://cryptpad.fr">CryptPad</a>
                . Here are a few examples:

                I believe that the ChatGPT community is still missing something like this and that together we can turn
                it into something really amazing, far beyond what I can imagine at the moment. I would be very happy if
                my program could be tried by as many people as possible and I could get constructive feedback regarding
                bugs and new features - maybe even a new tool via pull request. The whole thing is written in Kotlin
                with the Swing GUI Toolkit and on the GitHub page you can find more information as well as a beta
                installer for Windows (.exe) and Linux (.deb):
