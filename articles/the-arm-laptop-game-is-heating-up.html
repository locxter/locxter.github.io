            <h2>The ARM laptop game is heating up</h2>
            <h3>2024-05-24</h3>
            <p>
                On the search for my next laptop with good performance, a slim and lightweight design as well as
                outstanding battery life (which is the biggest gripe I have with my current ThinkPad X390 Yoga), I
                naturally started looking at the current MacBook lineup due to its outstanding efficiency and thus
                runtime. But after 4 years of Apple dominanting the ARM laptop game with class-leading performance and
                runtime, Qualcomm + Microsoft are finally playing tag and apparently catching up...
            </p>
            <p>
                My number one source of laptop reviews, news and just general information is
                <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/">Notebookcheck</a>
                and has been for many years. When looking at their review of the current
                <a
                    href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-M3-review-A-lot-faster-and-with-Wi-Fi-6E.811129.0.html"
                >
                    M3 MacBook Air
                </a>
                , we find out that the ARM-based M3 chip inside outperforms basically anything in single-core
                performance, manages to keep up quite well in multi-core and especially is very power efficient, which
                is also the reason why this laptop with only a 52.6 Wh battery has basically the best battery life out
                of all tested devices - except for the
                <a
                    href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-Dragonfly-G4-laptop-review-Small-updates-over-the-already-excellent-Dragonfly-G3.734627.0.html"
                >
                    HP Dragonfly G4
                </a>
                , but that also requires a massive 68 Wh unit to just slightly outperform the Air.
            </p>
            <p>
                This example shows us that there definitely is a point to ARM laptops with their more than good-enough
                performance and huge benefits in power efficiency, which has a way more significant impact on perceived
                usability of a device than just a little more performance. I would take a laptop with a measurably
                better runtime over one with slightly or even meaningful better performance any day of the week and
                twice on Sunday - just like most the programmers I know and people I talk to. For normal office work and
                even some more niche activities like development or casual CAD design most laptops are plenty fast these
                days, so you don't really benefit from higher synthetic benchmark score - what you do benefit from in
                the real world however is better battery life. There just is a certain kind of disappointment to buying
                and using an expensive laptop, but having to worry about battery life and needing to carry a charge
                everywhere - which is the main reason for Apple's success in the laptop business lately IMHO, as they
                are the only one's excelling in this categorie.
            </p>
            <p>
                Granted, when looking at

                compilation from Notebookcheck, you can also find some quite long-lasting laptops with traditional x86
                processors - besides the already mentioned HP Dragonfly G4 primarily the

                . But despite their slightly larger batteries they can't even come close to the MacBook Air's runtime
                under light use (video playback) and lack significantly behind under heavy loads, which shows that there
                just is an engineering barrier keeping x86 from leading in this area. That's why I'm super excited that
                Qualcomm released their ARM-based X Elite chip for laptops and the

                .
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike prior attempts from Microsoft with basically enhanced smartphone chips developed together with
                Qualcomm, the X Elite is a real competition for Apple's M3, which finally creates some competition in
                this sector. According to first tests the X Elite even outperforms the base M3 in multi-core scenarios,
                which IMHO put Apple under so much tension that they released their new iPad Pro with M4 processor a
                little earlier to keep the performance crown in the ARM sector. The M4
                <a

                    >seems to measurably beat the X Elite</a
                >
                in basically every way, but the ARM laptop game is certainly heating up, which is a good thing in my
                mind. Competition always boosts development and generally benefits the consumer by leading to better
                products than those released in a vacuum. I'm really interested in how this will develop...
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing we completely ignored so far however is software support and this one will arguably decide
                whether or not ArightRM is the future of mainstream computing. When Apple released their M1 back in
                2020, they provided the Rosetta 2 emulation layer to run older x86-only apps, but encouraged (some might
                even say forced) developers to update their apps due to the closed nature of their platforms with tight
                control over what is allowed and what isn't - this basically means that most developers didn't have an
                alternative to porting their apps over, if they don't want to miss out on all Mac users. With the X
                Elite this is a different picture, since it runs Windows on ARM, which coexists with the regular x86
                Windows and only makes up a tiny percentage of all installations right now. This means that developers
                have little incentive to spend the time porting their apps, which then might keep away the wast majority
                of users from switching to WoA due to lacking application support. Microsoft has also developed an
                emulation layer for x86 apps, but it remains to be seen how well it really performs and how good
                application support with the notoriously complicated legacy-features of Windows is.

                Sadly for me, I'm looking for a new laptop with excellent battery life and good performance that just
                works
                <strong>right now</strong>
                and the X Elite only supports WoA for the foreseeable future, which is a no-go for me. I need a
                Unix-based operating system to get my stuff done and feel at home, so only Linux and MacOS are really an
                option.
                <a
                    href="https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/blog/2024/05/upstreaming-linux-kernel-support-for-the-snapdragon-x-elite"
                >
                    Qualcomm announced that they are working on Linux support
                </a>
                and have already upstreamed some of the necessary changes to the Linux kernel, but from my experience
                with new devices on Linux this takes at least two or three years until it is stable and everything at
                least somewhat works, which is too much waiting for me. Furthermore, battery runtime of x86 laptop has
                always been worse on Linux by 25 to 50 % for me due to missing optimizations and this trend will likely
                continue with the X Elite, so my best bet for a long-endurance programming laptop currently seems to be
                a MacBook. MacOS isn't great, but at least it's Unix-based, somewhat trustworthy as well as highly
                customizable and Apple has proven to provide excellent battery life with their laptops over the last few
                years. The prices (especially for upgrades) are outrageous, but most business laptops I have been
                looking at aren't much cheaper and for someone who uses their devices as extensively as me almost any
                price is a good investment.

                With that said, I hope you found this article interesting and got a bit of insight into the current ARM
                laptop developments as well as my personal struggles with choosing a new device. If you have any
                thoughts, feel free to share them in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
