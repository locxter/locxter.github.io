            <h2>Adding comments with giscus</h2>
            <h3>2022-11-20</h3>
            <p>
                I am a huge fan of the KISS principle, which is also the reason why I write this blog in plain HTMl
                without even using one of the excellent static site generators like
                <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
                . However, I feel like having comments on a blog is a non-debatable requirement. Therefore, I searched a
                bit for a fitting solution, found giscus and now want to enable you to use it as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by the very popular
                <a href="https://utteranc.es/">utterances</a>
                , which uses GitHub Issues to host comments on static sites like this one,
                <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus</a>
                is based an the newer GitHub Discussion system. To be clear:
                <strong>Both are fantastic projects!</strong>
                But I think that giscus uses a better fitting and more appropriate implementation and that is why I
                personally chose it over utterances.
            </p>
            <p>In order to use it yourself, you have to meet several requirements though:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You have a GitHub account and a public repository to store the comments in.</li>
                <li>
                    You installed the giscus app on your GitHub account.
                    <a href="https://github.com/apps/giscus">Here</a>
                    is the link to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You enabled the Discussions feature for the desired repository.
                    <a
                        href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository"
                    >
                        Here
                    </a>
                    is how to do that.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If that is all set, you can head over to the
                <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus site</a>
                and configure it to your liking. After filling out the bare minimum fields like the language and
                repository to use, I personally recommend to do several other tweaks:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Change the Discussion mapping to
                    <code>Discussion title contains page title</code>
                    .
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enable
                    <code>Use strict title matching</code>
                    to avoid mismatches.
                </li>
                <li>Create a special Discussion category for comments and select it.</li>
                <li>
                    Enable
                    <code>Place the comment box above the comments</code>
                    for easier usage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enable
                    <code>Load the comments lazily</code>
                    for better loading times, especially if there are many comments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Choose the color scheme that fits your site's theme best. I use
                    <code>Transparent Dark</code>
                    .
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Finally, copy the generated HTML snippet over to your site template and enjoy comments!</p>
