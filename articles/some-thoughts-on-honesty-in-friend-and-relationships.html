            <p>
                Even though some might not like to admit it, keeping a good and healthy connection to our family,
                friends and especially our better half is of crucial importance. In this article I want to present some
                of my thoughts on the role of honesty in this context...
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of you might argue that talking about honesty is unnecessary and a pure waste of time as we
                obviously do not lie to the people who are important to us all the time and generally tell them the
                truth. However, I am also not thinking about honesty as the way we interact with all the people around
                us such as colleagues and strangers, but as a way to allow persons we fully trust and value to "look
                into our heads" and understand our thoughts. Let me explain that a bit more:
            </p>
            <p>
                Most problems and disputes in families, friendships as well as relationsships can be put down to bad
                communication and missunderstandings, which both ultimately cause frustration and therefore are the
                ideal foundation for large, sometimes deadly conflicts. By not only being honest, but
                <strong>brutally, shamelessly, deeply honest</strong>
                down to our self-image we can greatly mitigate these risks. Exposing all of our thoughts and not trying
                to hold something we might consider embarrassing or painful back not only illustrates our trust in
                someone, but allows them to build and maintain exceptional sympathy with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also play this game the other way around and all of a sudden you are able to get a grip on opinions as
                well as character traits of someone else you previously believed to be impossible! It certainly is
                <strong>not easy</strong>
                to open up yourself this far for others and requires a lot of time to build the required trust, but it
                can fundamentally change the way we interact with and see the people we care about the most. Especially,
                in todays mistrust-driven world, where everyone always thinks the worst about people he is interacting
                with, such a practice can have
                <strong>huge influence</strong>
                .
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully, I could encourage you to think a bit about the way you deal with others and just maybe lay
                the foundations to a very valuable skill of yours. As always, getting started is the most important step
                - so do it now, before the motivation or the circumstances are possibly gone forever...
            </p>
