            <h3>2023-06-18</h3>
            <p>
                When I take a look around my circle of friends or peers in my age in general, I can't help but come to
                the conclusion that my generation is fundamentally broken. And I'm not talking about these factually
                wrong ideas of us Gen Zs not wanting to work or being politically apathetic. I'm talking about an almost
                omnipresent psychological crack caused by today's society. Let me explain...
            </p>
            <p>
                My generation certainly is the best connected and informed, physically healthiest (sports and nutrition)
                and most inclusive (LGBTQIA+) one in history. We are also one of the generations that likes to set their
                own definition of a "good life" (like trying to travel as much as possible and enjoy live, earning only
                what you need and reducing work time to 30 h or a 4 day week for a better work-live balance) and doesn't
                fear fighting against social standards (40 h middle-class office job as THE goal) in order to make it a
                reality. Especially in wealthy countries like Germany, we also live in "the land of plenty", most of us
                never had to experience any major shortages of essential goods, we can fulfil most of our materialistic
                wishes and until recently didn't even have to think about the risk of war (Russia ruining this run of
                piece of course). With all of this, we should be the happiest generation ever too, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, as it turns out we also are one of the generations or possibly THE generation that's the loneliest
                and most effected by mental illnesses ranging from (occupational) burnouts over self-distructive
                behaviour to existential crisis. Don't believe me? Take a look at official reports from the WHO or your
                local health ministry and you are going to see a skyrocketing number of cases. And you know what? It's
                not even our fault! This is an result of the ever decreasing number of real life social interactions and
                supposedly dystopian future presented to us by the media, all of which is heavily accelerated or even
                <strong>made possible by the internet</strong>
                . You heard right, I as an extremely tech-savvy person make the worldwide miracle of interconnected
                computers responsible for all of this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, the internet isn't inherently bad (just like any other technology) and opened the door to
                many priorly unthinkable achievements like productive asynchronous communication between millions. But I
                also truly believe that exactly this concept of sending a digital message to someone or a whole
                community and waiting (or craving) for a response was the first step towards the ever increasing
                distance between individuals. Nowadays with these numerous sophisticated social media platforms using
                self-learning algorithms to maximize screen time by all costs, we not only notice an inevitable decrease
                in productivity (Can't work while watching TikTok, huh?), but also the hardware limitations of your
                monkey brians.
            </p>
            <p>
                You see, we humans we're able to shape the world to our likings (I won't answer the question whether or
                not that's a good thing, but you probably already know the answes), because we are an incredible social
                species and try to mirror others' behaviour in order to learn new skills and fit into a group. This
                ability of so-called
                <strong>Social Learning</strong>
                only enabled our rise to the top of species since not every invidiual had to figure out how to make fire
                him- or herself, but could copy this skill from someone else and use his limited lifetime to develop new
                ones. But on almost any social media platform we are confronted not only with unrealistic beauty,
                fitness, success or whatever ideals, but so many of them that we can't possibly manage to mirror them
                all. This leads to unavoidable failure (because our inner-monkey will try anyway) and can cause major
                psychological harm in the long run when many of these events pile up, especially if you have a genetic
                tendency for mental illnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                THIS is why my generations is currently effected the most as we basically grew up with Facebook,
                Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Snapchat and whatever they all call themselves, but this problem will only
                become bigger as time progresses and more and more generations grow up this way. Personally, I believe
                VR and AR (as shown in countless movies such as the excellent Ready Player One) to be the ultimate
                danger, because the technologies in combination with a true metaverse open up the possibilty for a whole
                life time without real world interactions. At that point, the only solution I see to keep the society
                working is to pump the population full of mood boosters via their food and drinks.

                I know that this one has been a bit of a depressing article, so I want to close with a positive note. We
                aren't in that dystopia yet, there are countless people out there waiting for you to call them for an
                outdoor activity and YOU are still in control of your digital devices, not the other way around. If you
                feel the need to limit their impact on your life, take a look at my article "

                </a>
                " as a starting point. As always, feel free to share you thoughts in the comments down below...
