                I hate to admit it, but especially in everyday situations where you need to quickly share files between
                devices, proprietary features like Apple's AirDrop can be really handy. Luckily, even for those of us
                who are not willing to afford Apple devices or have to deal with different ecosystems, some easy-to-use
                and free solutions for instantaneous file sharing via the local network exist. So, let's take a quick
                look at my favorite two of them - Snapdrop and LocalSend...
            </p>
            <p>
                First and foremost, we should be on the same page about the working principle and thus use-case for
                these solutions. Unlike with big cloud providers, you don't upload your files to a centralized server,
                which then distributes the file to new devices - instead your devices connect locally from peer to peer
                and transfer the data this way. This allows you to instantly share files without much preparation or
                delays from first having to upload the data, but also means that it is quite inefficient for big files
                or sharing data with many devices. For such use-cases, you're still clearly better off with using a
                centralized file sharing solution of your choice. Nonetheless, this approach is ideal for quickly moving
                files between devices on the go and certainly has a right to exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, none of the popular proprietary solutions like AirDrop or Google's NearbyShare (now also
                called QuickShare) is available across all platforms - making it only useful for certain types of OS
                combinations. Thankfully, the open source community has stepped in and created many wonderful solutions
                that truly work across all common platforms and are also free to use. Probably the most well-known of
                them is
                <a href="https://snapdrop.net">Snapdrop</a>
                - a website you open on two or more devices in the same network and that transfers files between them
                peer to peer without any software installation. This is really handy, since it works in every browser
                with support for WebRTC - but also limits its feature set a bit and can be buggy depending on the
                browser combination used. This is where
                <a href="https://localsend.org/">LocalSend</a>
                steps in and offers an equally flexible as well as easy-to-use solution that certainly works since it
                uses dedicated apps on all platforms to transfer the data. It again uses WebRTC under the hood and thus
                makes sure to encrypt your data, but also goes a step further featurewise. For example, it offers you
                the ability to mark devices as favorites and shows you a progress bar for big files - both of which
                Snapdrop lacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the next time you need to move files between devices, certainly make sure to give one or both of
                these solutions a go - you might even be able to impress some Apple users with an equally nice solutions
                that doesn't come from Cupertino. With that said, feel free to share your thoughts, experiences and
                recommendations in the comments down below, have a lovely day and until next week...
