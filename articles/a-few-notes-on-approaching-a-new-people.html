            <h2>A few notes on approaching a new people</h2>
            <h3>2024-11-09</h3>
            <p>
                Having moved to Stuttgart just over a month ago, I naturally found (and still find) myself in
                situations, where I'm the awkward foreign person among all the locals and have to approach new people.
                While this can feel quite uncomfortable, I have surprisingly really enjoyed it so far and want to share
                a few insights I have learned along the way with you in this little article...
            </p>
            <p>
                As already mentioned in many of my recent posts, I have just started studying computer science in
                Stuttgart as a part of my dual study program from a big German automotive company. This means that while
                I'm in a new city and new surrounding, there are many people having the same struggles around me - both
                at university and the company - naturally making the whole experience of connection to new people and
                building a network easier. I strongly believe however, that the experiences I made can still be
                generalized and should apply to people in all stages of life - although the exact details or effort
                involved might vary.
            </p>
            <p>
                But enough of this preparation talk, here's the number one thing I have learned:
                <strong>
                    Most (if not all) people you meet and talk to for some time turn out to be really nice and open -
                    even towards total strangers.
                </strong>
                This is something every one of us should make sure not only to know, but also truly believe. In the
                news, we often hear these horror stories of what bad things can happen when meeting strangers and
                trusting them even just a little bit, but in reality nice people actually are the vast majority and you
                almost have to specially try to find such evil actors. This means that you really don't have to worry
                about having a great evening at a bar or whatever if you are alone - you can be sure to have an amazing
                time, if you choose so. You obviously need to be brave enough to approach people and have a conversation
                with them - which can be hard for the more introverted ones among us - but once you "know" one or two
                people you are often introduced to a bunch more, opening the door to connecting with a circle of
                friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we are already talking about connecting to people, I also want to encourage you to feel free to
                ask for the contact data of a person you have talked to for some time or share your own with them. This
                doesn't mean that you should walk around and offer your phone number to everyone, but after talking for
                15 minutes or half an hour why not ask them if they would mind exchanging contacts to maybe meet again
                at an event. It's important to have the right attitude here: You have nothing to lose, so why not try?
                If they reject your offer, you still had a good conversation and if they accept it, all the better.
                While phone numbers still work absolutely fine for connection with others and I hate to admit it, social
                media really is your friend for networking. At least here in Germany, particularly Snapchat, BeReal and
                among certain groups Instagram can be door openers, since they have an even less "official" character
                than messaging apps like WhatsApp. This means people don't worry too much about sharing their
                information, while still allowing you to connect with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we go, here are some more small tips I can give you. Generally speaking, try to stick with one
                group of people to talk to for the duration of the event if they seem nice and don't mind your presence.
                This allows you to build a stronger connection to them compared to wandering around all the time and
                only speaking with a group for a few minutes. Another really important point I want to make is that you
                should
                <strong>
                    always be respectful and shouldn't bother people clearly not interested in meeting new contacts
                </strong>
                .This is especially true for groups from another gender, since there is nothing more painful to watch
                than a man pestering a group of girls - you should stand above this level. Among the same lines is also
                the insight that you shouldn't be too drunk or otherwise effected by sedating substances when
                approaching new people - most (me included) certainly don't want to talk to someone not even able to
                form whole sentences anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said though, I hope to have made an understandable point in favour of approaching new people
                wherever possible and being brave enough to do so in new environments. As always, feel free to share
                your thoughts and experiences in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
