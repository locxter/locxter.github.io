            <h3>2023-03-12</h3>
            <p>
                Continuing my journey towards a computing setup that strikes the perfect balance between productivity
                and digital well-being, I want to present an amazing piece of software called
                <a href="https://workrave.org/">Workrave</a>
                to you in this article. Everyone can relate to these situations where you have been starring at your
                screen for way too long, your wrists start you hurt and you need to go to the toilet badly, but you want
                to fix this last annoying issue beforehand and just can't find figure it out. Thanks to Workrave, this
                doesn't have to happen anymore...
            </p>
            <p>
                According to its website, Workrave is "a free program that assists in the recovery and prevention of
                Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)". In other words, it is a software to prevent you from starring at your
                screen for too long without a break. It does this by monitoring your mouse and keyboard usage (without
                storing any of the moves you do with the mouse or text piece you type), calculating the time you spend
                in front of your computer using this information and then forcing you to take breaks by blocking any
                inputs during rest periods.
            </p>
            <p>
                One specialty of Workrave is that it diffentiates between so-called "micro-breaks", which are ment to be
                short, but frequent relax sessions, and longer "rest breaks", which are less frequent, but last for a
                few minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can even decide to be shown a random set of exercises during your rest breaks and get a bit
                physically active - simply change the option
                <code>Number of exercises</code>
                in the
                <code>Rest break</code>
                section.

                Last but certainly not least, it features a daily limit and long-time statistics to get you away from
                that screen back into the real world every once in a while and make you realize just how much of your
                time you really spend glued to the computer.

                Personally, I like to take 30 second microbreaks every 29:30 minutes (so every half hour) and 2:30
                minute rest break every 57:30 minutes (so every hour) since I found this to be the perfect balance
                between having time to relax and being annoyed by all these breaks. But try out what works best for you
                and let me know about your findings down below in the comments...
