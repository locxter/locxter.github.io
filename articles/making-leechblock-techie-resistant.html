            <h3>2023-02-23</h3>
            <p>
                Most of us know these situations when we actually want to start working on the next billion dollar app,
                but somehow get stuck on our favourite social media platform (I also include watching educational
                YouTube videos here), a Wikipedia reference loop or just a weird web page. This is where
                <a href="https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a>
                as a FOSS and highly configurable content blocker comes to the rescue and allows us to restrict our
                possibibility to those that are beneficial to us in the long run. However, there a some drawbacks for
                techies in the default config...
            </p>
            <p>
                Probably the biggest one is the fact that you can simply go to the extension settings of your browser (
                <code>about:addons</code>
                in Firefox and
                <code>chrome://extensions</code>
                in Chromium) and deactivate LeechBlock there. Luckily, the developers have thought of this and added the
                option
                <code>Prevent access to about:addons at times when these sites are blocked</code>
                /
                <code>Prevent access to Extensions page at times when these sites are blocked</code>
                in the
                <code>Advanced Options</code>
                section of a set to keep yourself from doing this.
            </p>

                <img
                    src="../images/articles/making-leechblock-techie-resistant/extension-settings-control.svg"
                    alt="Extension settings control"
                />
                <figcaption>Extension settings control</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Most users will also enable one of the access control options (probably a random access code) on first
                setup to further restrict themselves from deactivating the blocker in weak moments and that is a great
                initial step.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img
                    src="../images/articles/making-leechblock-techie-resistant/access-control.png"
                    alt="Access control"
                />
                <figcaption>Access control</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, many techies will also be fast to figure out that you can just open the developer tools
                and copy the access code from there rendering the access control virtually useless.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img
                    src="../images/articles/making-leechblock-techie-resistant/hacking-access-control.png"
                    alt="Hacking the access control"
                />
                <figcaption>Hacking the access control</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                However, LeechBlock's developers also got you covered here and in the
                <code>General</code>
                tab there is a option
                <code>Display access code as image</code>
                to use a
                <code>canvas</code>
                object instead of regular text for the access code. It is right besides the important option to change
                the theme to a dark one.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img
                    src="../images/articles/making-leechblock-techie-resistant/image-access-control.png"
                    alt="Image access control"
                />
                <figcaption>Image access control</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                This makes it impossible to simply copy the access code and therefore actually prevents you from wasting
                your time on sites you really do not want to spend time on.
            </p>

                />

                Hopefully, this small tutorial introduced you to or at least extended your knowledge of the amazing
                productivity tool that LeechBlock is. I highly recommend to give it try...
