            <h2>Everything is figureoutable</h2>
            <h3>2024-01-05</h3>
            <p>
                The new year has only just begun and I'm already seeing people losing sight of their goals left and
                right or giving up on them altogether. As always, this has nothing to do with a lack of discipline, but
                can be attributed to a tremendous fear of failure and a hard time breaking down these abstract wishes
                into daily, managable actions, which move you closer to your goal. With that said, this is a bit of an
                inspirational one to help you push through these initial motivation problems...
            </p>
            <p>
                The key sentence (and also general attitude) around motiviation to have embedded into your long-term
                memory is "
                <strong>Everything is figureoutable</strong>
                ". You should remind yourself of it whenever you feel that you have a personal limitation in a certain
                area, whenever you say to yourself "I can't do that", "It's not my thing", "It's not for me". Everyone
                has these struggles (imposter syndrome is just a small part of them), some more, some less, but I have
                not met a single person who's entirely free of these self-doubts. It's a very human thing to have them
                and from a broader you should probably be thankful for them, since they show you that your analytical
                brain functions are working as expected and you aren't too blind to see the challenges ahead of you.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what is even more important to understand is that no matter how big and overwhelming a challenge
                seems, all of these doubts are just beliefs - not facts or empirical results, just your beliefs.
                <strong>You think you can't do it. You think it doesn't suit you.</strong>
                You might even hear it from your own little devil on your shoulder at best or at worst from critical
                voices among your friends.
                <strong>
                    BUT that doesn't make it true, (almost) every mountain is climbable, (almost) every distance can be
                    travelled and (almost) every goal can be achieved.
                </strong>
                I use an "almost" here, since you have to be grounded to reality of course and some things (like
                becoming a billionaire or U.S. president) just require a decent amount of luck among effort to get
                right, but that doesn't stop you from dreaming, trying and hopefully succeeding at them. You just have
                to tackle them step by step every day (ideally starting with the 3-minute rule), evaluate your results
                from time time and adjust accordingly. No one said it would be easy, but it is certainly doable - at
                least as long as it doesn't violate the laws of physics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that this is easier said than done, but whenever something doesn't seem figureoutable at all,
                simply ask yourself:
                <strong>
                    Is there at least one person in the world, who is not a super genius and has solved this problem
                    before? Has ever learned this skill? Has anyone done it before you? Then you can do it too.
                </strong>
                That's all I have for this week, feel free to share your experiences in the comments down below and have
                a lovely day...
