            <h2>Some impressions of working with Kotlin Multiplatform</h2>
            <h3>2024-07-14</h3>
            <p>
                Some of you might know that I have failed to adopt Rust as my primary programming language replacing
                good-old C++ and instead fallen for Kotlin, which is an amazing modern replacement for Java with new
                features such as null-safety, immutable variables and type inference. However, until recently I have
                only ever developed desktop applications using their specific GUI toolkits (GTKmm for C++ and Swing for
                Java/Kotlin), but always wanted to delve into the world of cross-platform development. Here how my
                journey went and what impressions I have gathered by working with Kotlin Multiplatform...
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing to do was obviously to determine what cross-platform toolkit and language I should use.
                Most prominently there are the JavaScript-based solutions like React Native, Electron and Ionic out
                there, but these were almost instantly out of the question, since I personally hate web development,
                they only offer really limited support for platform-native functionality and for the most part only
                stretch across platforms horizontally (all mobile platforms + web, but not desktop or vice versa). Then
                there is .NET MAUI from Microsoft and Flutter from Google, which offer much greater functionality and
                have been quite battle-proven over the last few years. But I really don't want to rely on any Microsoft
                toolkit, quite dislike C# as a cheap Java clone and .NET MAUI doesn't support Linux as a target
                platform, so it's disqualified as well. Flutter on the other hand seems much more promising and has a
                good reputation, but sadly uses its own programming language Dart, which looks quite well designed, but
                I would have to learn it first and thus lock myself rather tightly into this ecosystem. This made it my
                "if nothing else works, I'll go with it"-choice, but I first wanted to further investigate Qt with
                multiplatform support and Kotlin Multiplatform. On the one hand, Qt is a really amazing toolkit, powers
                lots of commercial (mostly embedded) systems and super stable, but also has a really steep learning
                curve and seemed somewhat daunting to me, so I wasn't to keen on using it. On the other hand, there's
                Kotlin Multiplatform, which uses my beloved Kotlin programming language, allows for seemless integration
                with platform-specific code to any extent, but also offers a cross-platform UI framework that's
                basically a port of Jetpack Compose, which all the Android developers I know love. So that's what I went
                with, since I can start developing my app from a fully multiplatform target and add all the
                platform-specific functionality seemlessly in once I start to hit limitations. In an extreme case, this
                means that I can write the business logic code for cross-platform, but keep all the UI and IO code
                native to provide an optimal experience and flexibility - which sounds nothing short of amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Setup was smooth just having to download Android Studio, install the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin and use
                their online wizard for creating a project to run on desktop and Android. I should probably note here,
                that shared UI for iOS still is in beta and the web target even in alpha, but the JetBrains team is
                actively working on these and since they aren't of any interest to me (I only care about all three
                desktop platforms and Android), I decided to use it anyway. Working my way through the example projects
                and tutorials, I quickly discovered that Jetpack Compose truly is an amazing UI toolkit, with modern
                functionality, developer friendly async support and a pleasing default look. Connecting to native code
                via the
                <code>expect</code>
                and
                <code>actual</code>
                system for declaring functions is also really painless and works super well. Even Kotlin Multipform
                library support was suprisingly good for everything I needed (mostly API interactions via the network,
                settings storage and databases), but in case there isn't a cross-platform one available you can of
                course still choose native ones and connect them to your multiplatform code - nice. All of this creates
                an easy to use, productive and capable cross-platform toolkit that allows you to build projects of any
                size and complexity with the amount of shared code + libraries that is right for your needs.
            </p>

                However, not everything was perfect in my experience - indeed quite the opposite sometimes. I already
                said that some targets aren't stable yet, but the on-going development is much deeper than this with
                some fundamental functionality still missing or being experimental, which means not usable in a
                production environment in either case from my perspective. This includes not being able to use seemingly
                basic UI components like a dropdown, time or date picker, which requires you to build your own clunky
                components that are much more error prone and just shouldn't need to exist. Futhermore, even the
                official navigation and routing library (artifact
                <code>org.jetbrains.androidx.navigation:navigation-compose</code>
                ) is still in an experimental state, so I had to use the excellent community library
                <a href="https://voyager.adriel.cafe/">Voyager</a>
                , which works exceptionally well, is easy to use and provides all the functionality I could want - but
                again this just shouldn't be necessary. And so far I probably only have scratched the surface, since
                there are even more workarounds needed for certain functionality. What I want to say is that you
                shouldn't expect a fully polished and stable product to rely on with your billion dollar business quite
                yet. It's really impressive what the JetBrains team has pulled of in the last couple of years (like
                replacing Java with Kotlin as the officially recommended language for Android development), Kotlin
                Multiplatform is already nicely usable for the most part and it's only getting better with each day. By
                choosing it, you are investing somewhat into promises and future capabilities however, which is
                something you should only do if you can already live with its current state and don't depend on these
                promises.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, I'm having a great time with Kotlin Multiplatform (even) right now, really enjoy running my
                code on desktop as well as mobile with minimal to no changes and truly believe that they will get
                everything working as well as stable in the next one or two years, which is something I can live with
                for my hobby projects. If you are searching for a cross-platform toolkit yourself, certainly give Kotlin
                Multiplatform a go and feel free to share your thoughts and experiences in the comments down below. With
                that said, have a lovely day...
