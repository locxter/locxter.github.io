            <p>Many people still remember it vividly and just as many stll have it ahead of them - the wisdom teeth removal. Mine was this week, so let's talk a bit about my experiences...</p>
            <p>The removal of my 4 wisdoom teeth had been planned for a long time, but honestly I did not know what to expect since I had never been under general anaesthesia or had a tooth extraction before. Furtunately, the experience at the dentist was very pleasant and the surgery itself was no big deal from my perspective. After sitting in the waiting area with my parents for a bit, my name was called out, I was led into the surgery room and the team began preparing me for anesthesia while distracting me with small talk until I was no longer responsive and they could start working. The next thing I remember is me lying in the recovery room and talking rubbish to my parents. This quickly got better though, I felt pretty good and after about one hour we were allowed to leave.</p>
            <p>
                Heck, when coming home I even thought that I could enjoy the following free days. This obviously did not come true, because my whole mouth started
                <strong>swelling like crazy</strong>
                and required a lot of cooling, which seemingly did not do anything and therefore was quite frustrating. Luckily, it did not hurt that badly and I spent the next three days reading the whole "The Hunger Games" trilogy (which is excellent by the way) to somewhat escape reality while
                <strong>constantly cooling</strong>
                my cheeks with a few breaks. The worst part for me was eating though as I basically ate slightly differently flavoured apple sauce as well as very fine mashed potatoes over and over again.

            <p>
                After the first three days, the swelling finally got a lot better, I could start eating somewhat normal food like scrambled eegs or small noodles again and ultimately started thinking that
                <strong>things are getting better`</strong>
                . This led me to writing this article as I felt really devastated for the last few days and want to encourage people in the same situation to look forward with the certainty that everything will get better very soon. You are not alone with these feelings and they are absolutely normal in this situation, but do not let them drag you down to much! You will get back on track and that is what counts...
