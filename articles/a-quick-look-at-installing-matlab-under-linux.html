            <h2>A quick look at installing MATLAB under Linux</h2>
            <h3>2025-02-02</h3>
            <p>
                This week has been quite busy, so let's just take a quick look at one of the rather unique things I had
                to do during it - installing MATLAB under Linux...
            </p>
            <p>
                After raging a bit about the fact that there is no proper way of installing it via any package manager
                (even snap would have been fine for me), I firstly went on to visit the
                <a href="https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MathWorks website</a>
                and create a student account for a free license. Once that is done the
                <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html">
                    official instructions
                </a>
                simply want you to download a compressed
                <code>.zip</code>
                folder, extract it and basically run with that - but that's obviously too clunky for me as proper
                high-performer ;)
            </p>
            <p>Here's how to install it properly or at least make the best out of the mess we have to deal with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Extract the
                    <code>.zip</code>
                    file to a
                    <code>/.FILENAME</code>
                    folder in your home directory
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open a terminal inside that folder and run the installation script with admin privileges via
                    <code>sudo -H ./install</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simply run through the installation process leaving all the defaults as they are, but ...
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            ... write down the installation folder (
                            <code>/usr/local/MATLAB/R2024b</code>
                            for me)
                        </li>
                        <li>... install all necessary modules (just MATLAB and Simulink for me)</li>
                        <li>
                            ... choose to create symbolic links in the default folder (
                            <code>/usr/local/bin</code>
                            for me)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then we need to integrate MATLAB into our desktop environment via the
                    <code>matlab-support</code>
                    package:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Install it via
                            <code>sudo apt install matlab-support</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Check that the installation folder matches the actual one</li>
                        <li>Specify authorized users if needed</li>
                        <li>
                            Maybe rename MATLAB's GCC libraries if they cause any conflicts (they haven't for me so far)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>And now you're done with just setting up the basic MATLAB experience</li>
                <li>
                    If you like dark mode just as much as I do, you might also want to install the
                    <code>New Desktop for MATLAB Tech Preview</code>
                    add-on and enable the dark UI under
                    <code>Preferences/Appearance</code>
                    - but keep in mind that it still is a preview and might cause instabilities
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With that said, I truly hope you never have to use this software though, since it seems really messy and
                over-grown like a tumor in my limited experience. As always, feel free to share your thoughts and
                experiences in the comments down below and have a lovely day...
