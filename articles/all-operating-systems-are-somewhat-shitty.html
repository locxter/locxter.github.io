            <h3>2024-03-10</h3>
            <p>
                I know that there haven't been that many tech-related articles lately, so it's time to change that. This
                week I want to do an all-around attack against the three major desktop operating systems, since I'm
                personally rather frustrated with the state of all of them. From my experience it isn't really a matter
                of choosing the best option, but rather the least bad one. So, let's take a look...
            </p>
            <p>
                Before get into the actual comparison, I want to state that this is mostly my personal take on things
                and your mileage may very - even though all the experiences are reproducable and have been confirmed to
                me from others. It should be also clear that I can't possibly take all the aspects into account that
                distinguish these operating systems from each other, so try to think of the aspects I do mention as some
                sort of starting point and feel free to build upon them yourself. Oh, and last but not least I'm just to
                lazy to turn all of my bullet points into full sentences, so you'll have to do with them ;)
            </p>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>The good:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exceptional software support and backwards compatibility</li>
                <li>Rather nice window management by default</li>
                <li>Huge marketshare and thus community</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The bad:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Huge legacy and compatibility needs only ever add bloat</li>
                <li>Not UNIX-based with a really "distinct", not to say ugly system architecture</li>
                <li>App installation is a nightmare (downloads from the web)</li>
                <li>All the omnipresent advertising, surveillance and AI shit</li>
                <li>
                    The goal isn't to make a good operating system, but one that's just not terrible enough for the user
                    to undergo the hassle of swit
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>macOS</h3>
            <p>The good:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>UNIX-based with full admin rights available (very much unlike iOS and iPadOS)</li>
                <li>Good app support with most professional software being available</li>
                <li>Good package manager available (Homebrew)</li>
                <li>
                    Exceptionally app sandboxing and read-only system files geatly increase the operational security
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unobtrusive and actually helpful smart features that mostly run on-device (live OCR in images, image
                    conversion, PDF annotation etc.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The bad:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Terrible window management</li>
                <li>Unusable dock, task-switcher and application closing procedure</li>
                <li>Distinct workflow in general (need to do things the "Apple way")</li>
                <li>App installation only mediocre by default (app store or .dmg downloads)</li>
                <li>The goal for the system is vendor-lockin since Apple still is primarily a hardware company</li>
                <li>Is also affected by Apple's slow but steady development into a marketing platform</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <p>The good:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When it works, it is extremely stable and reliable</li>
                <li>Endlessly customizable</li>
                <li>Great package management</li>
                <li>The only choice where you are still in full control over your PC</li>
                <li>Everything from no to all the window tiling available (personal must have)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The bad:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard to get it working</li>
                <li>Not everything even works at all</li>
                <li>Limited software support and overall nicheness</li>
                <li>Can be cumbersome to configure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As you can, you really have to pick your poison here - none of them is perfect. I'm currently rather
                happy with my Linux setup, but can honestly see myself transitioning to macOS in the long run due to the
                broader software support and just a more polished experience. What's is your take? Feel free to share
                share in the comments down below and have a good one...
