            <p>
                A few weeks ago, I just fiddled around with my website, changed the unordered list (
                <code>ul</code>
                ) of all my articles to an ordered one (
                <code>ol</code>
                ) and suddenly came to the realization that I'm really about to publish my 100th article - that's crazy.
                So, let's use this opportunity to look back and reflect on this project of mine a bit...
            </p>
            <p>
                It all started in November 2022 as an impulsive action after I had some gentle struggles with a person
                around me and needed a new project to focus on. I really like simplicity, so within a day or two I wrote
                some basic HTML, made it look somewhat acceptable with
                <a href="https://github.com/kognise/water.css">Water.css</a>
                , hosted it on the free Github Pages subdomain
                <a href="https://locxter.github.io">locxter.github.io</a>
                and published my first article. I then quickly noticed that a blog without a comment section doesn't
                really make any sense, so I added it shortly after with the help of
                <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus</a>
                . Later on, some more changes also took place: I switched to the current domain
                <a href="https://locxter.net">locxter.net</a>
                , added an Impressum and Datenschutzerklärung to conform with German law, started my own
                <a href="https://locxter.net/now.html">"Now" page</a>
                and once I realized what an amazing decentralized system RSS feeds are, I couldn't help and had to add
                it as well of course.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite having gotten exactly zero comments (apart from my test one) in the nearly two years I have been
                maintaining this site and regularly seeing very low page hits in my server logs, I'm quite proud of how
                everything turned out. Yeah, I'm not getting a lot (some might even say no) attention with this blog and
                it surely consumes some time to write these weekly articles, but that's not the point of it. I'm writing
                these articles to share (at least in my mind) valuable knowledge, discuss topics that matter to me and
                talk about issues I faced as well as how to solve them. If even a single person finds value in these
                articles or is inspired by it, it's already worth it. Despite all of that, I also really like the idea
                that I produce something long-lasting with this blog as well as my open source project on GitHub that
                might or might not leave an impact in the long run. And last but certainly not least, I just really
                enjoy writing regular blog posts (other ways I probably would have stopped by now), doing this has and
                continues to improve my English skills quite noticeably (despite the very much existing mistakes in
                almost all my articles) and it's just a satisfying habit by now that doesn't cost much effort to
                continue with.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, there are quite a few exciting personal and professional changes ahead of me (like
                starting a dual study program at a big German automotive company) that will provide great new insights
                to share and I'm really excited about the next 100 (and hopefully many more) articles to come. Have a
                lovely day and we will hear from each other next week...
            </p>
