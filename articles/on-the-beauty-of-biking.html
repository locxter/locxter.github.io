            <h2>On the beauty of biking</h2>
            <h3>2023-01-07</h3>
            <p>
                Besides my deep love for all kinds of technology and Sci-Fi books/movies, I really enjoy biking on every
                occasion possible. In this article I will try to present you the beauty I see in biking...
            </p>
            <p>
                First and foremost, biking is an
                <strong>excellent way to get from one location to another</strong>
                . It is super cheap as you do not have to pay for any fuel, healthy since you are at the fresh air as
                well as quite fast (especially in the city where cars often have to stop at traffic lights). Even rainy
                weather can not stop you with proper clothing or alternatively enough mental strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides that, cycling also is an
                <strong>amazing sport</strong>
                for people of all ages, because almost everyone already owns a bike and therefore does not have to
                invest large amounts of money to get started, it can be a very social activity when biking with others
                and it is very gentle on the joints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last but certainly not least, riding a bike also allows you to
                <strong>explore your surrounding area</strong>
                due its relatively large operation radius compared to walking or running. I am in the very fortunate
                situation of living in mid-sized city in the beautiful
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammerland">Ammerland</a>
                where I only have to drive 2 km to get to the middle of nowhere and biking allows me to explore the
                incredible beauty of local nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to become more active this year, cycling is very good and low-effort possibility to do so.
                Just get started...
            </p>

                PS: In the past week, Rust already turned out to be an amazing programming language with some very
                unique characteristics. Looking forward to using it in a project!
