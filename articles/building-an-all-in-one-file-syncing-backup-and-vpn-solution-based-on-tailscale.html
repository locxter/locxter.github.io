            <h2>Building an all in one file syncing, backup and VPN solution based on Tailscale</h2>
            <h3>2024-04-26</h3>
            <p>
                Like many other IT guys, I'm quite deep into creating backups of my files and following the 3-2-1 rule
                for securing my data (at least 3 copies of your data on at least 2 different storage mediums with at
                least 1 off-site backup) . But with me moving to a quite far city later this year, I had to redesign my
                current setup. So, let's take a look at the challenges I had to face and how Tailscale helped me to
                solve them easily...
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I'm syncing the files between my fully encrypted all-SSD laptop and desktop in a peer-to-peer
                manner using Syncthing and then daily create 2 mirrored backups on larger HDDs, one of which is
                permanently mounted in my desktop and one of which is portable to store at an off-site location if
                necessary. This only really meets the 3 and 2 part of the 3-2-1 rule, but has worked really well for me
                in the last couple of years and crucially only requires a minimal amount of storage capacity (and thus
                costs). When I move to another city however, I will leave my desktop at home and buy a second laptop
                (likely a MacBook Pro, shame on me), which changes the situations quite a bit. I still need to sync my
                files between two primary devices (the two laptops), but will also have a third one (my desktop)
                available as an off-site server with the ability to store versioned backups. The only big question is:
                How the hack can I access this server in a fast, easy and most importantly secure way?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, the easiest answer would be to simply use Syncthing's relay server infrastructure to route my
                encrypted data from peer to peer over the internet. This sounds really nice and requires zero additonal
                setup, but has never ever worked for me in my extensive testing (or only with really slow speeds of
                severals kilobytes). And honestly, I don't feel quite comfortable to route the data I invest so much
                effort to keep secure in over some random relay servers hosted by volunteers with questionable security
                practices. The next logical alternative is a virtual private network (VPN) to connect remotely to my
                home network. This certainly works and is rather easy to setup with the FRITZ!Box router we are using at
                home, but requires you to setup a static domain via a dynamic DNS service for easy access and exposes
                the whole network, which can be handy, but is way overkill for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where Tailscale comes to the rescue as it is an easy solution to built secure and flexible
                software-defined virtual networks. If this doesn't mean anything to you, let's just say that it allows
                you to flexibely connect individual devices together across physical network constraints without much
                setup and in a very secure manner. The majority of its source code is open source and for individual use
                it's even free, which makes it a perfect fit for my use case. The plan is to simply install the
                Tailscale client on all my devices, connect them together in a virtual network and configure my desktop
                a bit to work as a server (ssh access and the ability to run as an exit node). This will allow me to
                continue syncing my files peer-to-peer via Syncthing, run local backups of the synced data as I desire
                and even connect to my home network like any old VPN to use as a secure tunnel for internet access on
                public WiFis and the like. Here how to replicate my exact setup:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Create a
                    <a href="software-defined mesh virtual private network">Tailscale account</a>
                    using your favorite identity provider (I chose GitHub)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Download Tailscale on all your devices following
                    <a href="https://tailscale.com/download">their instructions</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1028/key-expiry">Disable key expiry</a>
                    on all the devices you feel comfortable doing so (at least the server) for more comfort (you don't
                    have to reauthenticate frequently)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure all your individual devices are interconnected with Syncthing and able to communicate (if
                    necessary, open your firewall for it via
                    <code>sudo ufw allow syncthing</code>
                    )
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disable the options
                    <code>Global Discovery</code>
                    and
                    <code>Enable Relaying</code>
                    in the
                    <code>Connections</code>
                    tab of Synthing settings to make sure that your devices only communicate via the local or Tailscale
                    network
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test whether or not Synthing still works with your devices on different networks - if that's all you
                    want, you can stop here
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since Tailscale networks are self-confined by default, you have to configure the server as an exit
                    node following
                    <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes?tab=linux">these instructions</a>
                    in order to use your Tailnet as a regular VPN
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are running a recent version of Tailscale and Linux kernel 6.2 or later, it is also worth to
                    optimize the server's network configuration following
                    <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1320/performance-best-practices#ethtool-configuration">
                        this guide
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now you can
                    <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes?tab=linux#step-4-use-the-exit-node">
                        use the exit node
                    </a>
                    like any other VPN if necessary
                </li>
                <li>
                    If your server is running a regular desktop distribution like mine does, you should remember to
                    disable all automatic suspend or sleep features via your system settings (since otherwise it won't
                    continue to run with no input and displays connected) and install a SSH server for easier management
                    via
                    <code>sudo apt install openssh-server</code>
                    and
                    <code>sudo ufw allow ssh</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, set up all the local backup solutions you like and configure them to run regularly on their
                    own (I do daily backups with Déjà Dup on the server)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                With that done, you now have a beautifully simple and secure all in one file syncing, backup and VPN
                solution based on Tailscale. This setup works beautifully for me and I'm very curious to hear from your
                experiences with Tailscale as well, so feel free to share them in the comments down below and have a
                lovely day...
