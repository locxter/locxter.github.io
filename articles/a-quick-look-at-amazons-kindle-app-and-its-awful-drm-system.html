            <h2>A quick look at Amazon's Kindle app and its awful DRM system</h2>
            <h3>2024-10-05</h3>
            <p>
                As an unwanted side effect of my 9-day cycling vacation in August, I had to travel with an absolute
                minimum of luggage and thus couldn't afford to bring one or two books - the usual amount I read in such
                a time span - with me. In the situation of sitting in an empty hotel room, seeking entertainment and not
                wanting to watch a stupid television program, I then fell for downloading the Amazon Kindle app to my
                phone. So, let's take a quick look at how I liked it and Amazon's awful Kindle DRM system...
            </p>
            <p>
                As taught in literally every course about human interaction, I'll start with the good this time around
                before coming to the bad. Much to my disliking, I was actually positively surprised by the Kindle app in
                terms of ease of use, features and the reading experience. Some might argue that there isn't much to
                rendering the text of a book on a screen and they are somewhat right, but somehow many e-book apps still
                manage to fuck this up. Not the Kindle app though - it has a relatively straightforward user interface,
                syncs beautifully over your Amazon account and even allows you to pay with it (which is as much a
                downside due to how many more books you buy as its ease of use is a positive aspect). Reading the book
                itself is as simple and clean as it should be with black-on-white or white-on-black text on a blank
                canvas only displaying the time as well as reading progress alongside the content. You simply flip the
                pages by tapping on the corresponding side of the screen or swiping across it and can access tons of
                helpful, but unobtrusive features like a dictionary, translator, highlighting tools, chapter overviews
                et cetera by long pressing on a section of text or the middle of the screen depending on what exactly
                you want to do. Especially the dark mode on an OLED screen with a mate screen protector is rather
                enjoyable to the eyes - even in the dark. I hate to say it, but it's actually a good app overall.

                Sure, there are some issues with it like the surely intense user tracking Amazon does or occasional
                crashes when copying text, but the real issues are the e-books Amazon sells themselves. You see, e-books
                are very much like email one of the very few types of digital media today, where open formats have won
                and are the most widely spread option used. In the e-book game
                <code>EPUB</code>
                is the unrivalled format king and almost every online seller uses it. It has one big downside for these
                companies though and that is the fact it wasn't designed with any kind of DRM (Digital Rights
                Management) in mind and thus has no protection against unauthorized copying and distribution out of the
                box. Granted, these features were added later on for better or for worse, but they still haven't become
                that widely used to date. That's why Amazon decided to use their own file format with strong DRM
                measures in place from the moment they launched their first Kindle and has stuck to it. Just like
                <code>EPUB</code>
                , it evolved over the years, expanded in features and in fact even changed its file extension from
                <code>AZW</code>
                over
                <code>AZW3</code>
                to
                <code>KFX</code>
                right now.

                But what has remained the same is its proprietary nature and strong encryption. This means once you
                bought a Kindle e-book, you're locked into the Kindle ecosystem and can only ever read it with one of
                Amazon's devices, their website or mobile app. There have been efforts to crack the format and convert
                it to
                <code>EPUB</code>
                in the form of extensions for the popular open source e-book management software
                <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">calibre</a>
                , but they only ever work with specific versions of the format and have become mostly unmaintained in
                the last years due to how complex it has become it get around Amazon's encryptions measures. Even worse,
                they obviously require you to provide the e-book file to them, but you can't easily download it from
                Amazon anymore. The only options are to download a book to the Android app and extract it from there,
                which is notoriously unreliable, or to transfer it to a real Kindle device and dump it from there, which
                I can't do without buying one just for this use-case. Ultimately, this means Amazon's DRM systems is
                basically like stealing your property - you don't pay for owning the book anymore, but just for the
                service of being allowed to read it.

                As someone that even backs up his Spotify playlists to local MP3 files, this feels awful and is a reason
                for me not to use the admittedly quite handy Kindle app on my phone anymore and not recommend the Kindle
                ecosystem. Luckily, they are more open e-reading solutions available I could have used, if I had looked
                a bit more closely at the topic on my vacation, and all books I wanted digitally so far are also
                available in other stores featuring the
                <code>EPUB</code>
                format. What do we learn from this?
